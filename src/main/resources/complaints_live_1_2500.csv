XXXX. An executor does not need to use any funds for the funeral. They can use it to pay off debts or handle probate proceedings. Why am I not able to access these funds without the very specific funeral expense receipt? 
XXXX. When I called customer service they clearly stated that I would need a court document stating I am the executor to be able to access the account but when I walked into the branch they didn't even care to see it. Who is PNC hiring to work at their branches?

On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from my insurance company that my home owners insurance had NOT been paid. I called my insurance company to verify and to ensure that the correspondence/payments had not crossed communications paths. They in fact had NOT received payment for my homeowners insurance. I agreed to call back after the new year 's holiday to verify payment. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX, and payment had not been received. I called New Rez, and discovered that they did not send payment to the correct insurance company. ( Note : this is the ONLY Insurance company I've had homeowners with since purchasing this house. It has NEVER changed names or locations. ) In a XXXX way call with myself, New Rez argued that they would post date a check and put in in the mail today ; however, insurance company, the insurance company stated that there is NO grace period, and that payment MUST be received by XXXXXXXX XXXX. on XX/XX/XXXX or I would not have insurance, and that I would not be eligible for reinstatement. After some discussion and arguments quite frankly between the insurance provided and New Rez, New Rez agree to stop payment on check and that they would pay via phone electronically to my insurance XXXX before close of business. 
After hours on the phone and multiple call backs ( on recorded lines ) New Rez had not made payment by close of business on Friday, and I was promised that they would do so on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. They did not, and as of XXXX XXXX XXXX, New Rez has still NOT paid my insurance premiums. I was forced to do so with money I do not have to ensure no gap in coverage.

2024-11-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information is missing that should be on the report,""" The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent.

I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report. Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role and have a responsibility to report consumer information to the best of their ability with maximum possible accuracy like the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly states. I did not provide written consent to report them.

Also on this same day my cellphone service was fraudulently changed from XXXX XXXX XXXX to another carrier. I had no service for the whole day. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and found out what had happened and immediately got my service turned back on. During the time my cell phone was changed to new carrier someone was able to move money around in my different accounts with Wells Fargo. I have their mobile app and online banking. They took money out of all the savings accounts and moved it to the checking account that is tied to the debit card with the fraudulent charges. I immediately called Wells Fargo fraud department and reported everything. They opened a claim. I visited my Wells Fargo branch as soon as possible and sat down with a representative who assured me that I did not need to change my account and I just needed a new debit card. After XXXX  days Wells Fargo refunded the stolen money back into my checking account. I visited my Wells Fargo branch again and sat with the same representative. She now said that I need to change my accounts before they could let me back onto online banking. I did as they asked. On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo took back the money they had provisionally given me and said that they could not prove fraud. No one had ever called to talk to me about it or get any more information from me. I have called XXXX XXXX and found that the address for the orders was in Florida. I have documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX showing that my phone was hacked. I thought your bank was supposed to help you in these situations. {$XXXX} dollars is not a lot to most people but it is a lot to my family.

This is the second dispute regarding this matter, following my previous complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, which has yet to be adequately resolved. 
Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) under 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 7 ), I request a detailed description of the investigation process your agency followed concerning this account. This information must be provided within 15 days, as stipulated by the FCRA. 
Details of the Dispute : The account in question has been incorrectly reported with late payments as follows : Equifax : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX These late payments are erroneous, as I consistently made all payments on time according to the agreed-upon terms. 
Account Information : Account Number : XXXX High Balance : {$31000.00} Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Date Closed : XX/XX/XXXX Current Status : Closed Account Type : Automotive Loan Payment Status : Paid or Paying as Agreed ( per XXXX and Equifax XXXX ; Incorrectly reported as "" Paid, was past due 30 days XXXX or XXXX times '' ( XXXX ). 
Monthly Payment : {$0.00} ( account closed ). 
Violation of Federal Laws : Under 15 USC 1681c, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they report. Late payments negatively impact my credit history and do not align with my actual payment history. Further, per 15 USC 1681s-2 ( b ), furnishers of information are obligated to correct inaccuracies upon dispute. 
Additionally, under 15 USC 1666 ( b ), creditors are required to adopt reasonable procedures to ensure statements and due dates are communicated appropriately to consumers.

Reference to PAANL ( Paid As Agreed Never Late ) : The terms of my agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX have always been adhered to. This account should reflect a status of "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late '' because all payments were made in a timely manner. 
The inaccurate reporting of late payments undermines my financial responsibility and adversely affects my creditworthiness. As the FCRA mandates, consumer reports must be accurate and complete. Failure to correct this error will constitute a breach of this obligation. 
To clarify, under 15 USC 1681a ( c ) and 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ), information reflecting transactions and experiences solely between me ( the consumer ) and the creditor must be reported accurately. Reporting incorrect late payments violates this requirement. 
Requested Action : Immediate Correction : Update the payment history on this account to reflect "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late '' across all three credit bureaus. 
Investigation Documentation : Provide a description of the procedures used to investigate this dispute, including the steps taken to verify the accuracy of the reported late payments. 
Proof of Late Payments : If the late payments can not be corrected, provide documented proof, including dates, amounts, and supporting communication validating these claims. 
Supporting Documentation : Enclosed, you will find : My previous dispute letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
Copies of my credit reports from XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax showing the incorrect late payment entries. 
Expectations and Compliance : Per the FCRA, I request a written response within 30 days of receipt of this letter. Failure to correct these inaccuracies or provide the required documentation will be considered a violation of the FCRA and may lead to further action. 
I trust your agency will take immediate action to ensure my credit report reflects accurate and fair information. I expect a resolution that aligns with the legal obligations outlined by the FCRA, the Consumer Protection Act, and the Truth in Lending Act.

( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) This act ensures transparency in lending practices. If XXXX  XXXX is reporting inaccurate credit information that is potentially fraudulent, they are violating TILA by failing to provide consumers with accurate and clear information regarding their credit accounts. ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) State Consumer Protection Laws Depending on your state of residence, various state laws may provide additional consumer protections against unfair credit reporting and lending practices.

This law requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), Experian is legally required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Additionally, per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to comply with these provisions constitutes a violation of federal law.

I formally request that Experian : 1. Conduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : Such as XXXX, any other bill on my account 2. Provide all documentation used to verify the accuracy of the disputed information.

3. Correct or delete any information that can not be verified or is inaccurate, as required by law.

Given the CFPBs recent findings, I expect Experian to address this dispute with the highest level of diligence and in full compliance with legal requirements.

After a careful examination of my credit report, I have identified a significant error that is adversely affecting my creditworthiness. The issue at hand involves the inaccurate reporting of late payments, specifically 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day late payments, multiple times in connection with the repossession of the mentioned vehicle. They also never sent me a notice of sale or cancellation of contract since they sold my vehicle. they sent this to an old address. when i attempted to get the car back it was already sold. i was never told where the vehicle was etc.

The inaccurate listing of late payments is causing considerable harm to my credit score and is misleading as it suggests that I was delinquent on payments after the repossession had taken place. It is illogical and impossible for a repossessed vehicle to have accrued 90-day late payments multiple times when I no longer had possession of the vehicle.

This inaccurate reporting is damaging my creditworthiness and creating an unjust representation of my financial history. I request that you thoroughly investigate this matter and correct the entry accordingly.

The misreporting of this account has persisted for an extended period, and I have made previous attempts to rectify this issue without success.

I have repeatedly contacted Capital One to request the issuance of a Form 1099-C, as required under the Internal Revenue Code, but have not received any resolution despite multiple attempts over an extended period. 

Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), consumers are entitled to accurate and fair reporting of credit information. Furthermore, under IRS guidelines, when a debt is charged off, the creditor is typically required to issue a Form 1099-C if the debt meets specific thresholds for cancellation. This failure to provide a Form 1099-C has caused considerable personal and financial stress, as I need this documentation for my tax filings. 

Additionally, I have observed that Capital One continues to report late payments on this charged-off account each month. Once an account is charged off, the addition of late payments contradicts accurate reporting practices and unfairly penalizes my credit standing, further exacerbating my difficulties. 

This unresolved issue has had a profound and stressful impact on my life, preventing me from moving forward with purchasing my first home for my family. I request the CFPBs assistance in ensuring Capital One complies with its legal obligations by : 1. Issuing the Form 1099-C for the charged-off debt.

2. Ensuring the account is accurately reported on my credit file without further monthly late payment notations. 



I respectfully request a resolution to this matter within 15 days from the date of this letter. Please let me know if further information is required to expedite this process.

This failure violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 
FCRA Violations Under 15 U.S. Code 1681i, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information in consumer files. The presence of late payment notations that are demonstrably inaccurate violates this mandate. Additionally, creditors are obligated to send accurate information to the credit bureaus as outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2.

TILA Violations As per 15 U.S. Code 1666b, periodic statements must be provided at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting suggests that the creditor may have failed to comply with this requirement.

Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act ( PAANL ) This act reinforces the need for creditors to send timely and accurate statements to prevent unfair penalties to consumers, which has not been adhered to in this case.

The continuous failure to address these inaccuracies has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness, affecting my ability to secure credit and financial opportunities.

Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report.

Written confirmation of the correction within 15 business days.

This account is reporting conflicting information across credit bureaus, including discrepancies in the open dateone bureau reports XX/XX/XXXX, while another shows XX/XX/XXXX. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in the high credit balance and the date last active ( DLA ), which is critical in determining how long an account remains on a credit report. The DLA is listed as both XXXX and XXXX, raising concerns about potential re-aging of the account. 

The DLA plays a key role in determining the statute of limitations for debt collection and legal action. It appears that your company may have manipulated this date to make an old debt appear new, effectively restarting the reporting timeline and making it more difficult to remove outdated negative information. Credit reporting must be accurate and consistent across all bureaus, and the discrepancies in this account indicate misleading and inaccurate reporting, which is grounds for dispute. 

Furthermore, this account was sold to a third party, XXXX XXXX, yet I did not receive proper correspondence notifying me of this transfer. I am requesting copies of all communications regarding this sale, as well as documentation verifying the amount that was allegedly charged off, so I can confirm whether their reporting aligns with what your claim is. 

Lastly, I am formally requesting the deletion of this account due to inconsistent, inaccurate, and misleading information, as well as the absence of a 1099-C form, which should have been provided for a charged-off debt.

As a result, my private financial details may have been improperly accessed or disclosed, which violates my fundamental right to privacy.

If an account or collection item is the result of a data breach or improper access to your personal information, it is considered inaccurate and unauthorized reporting, which can lead to harm in terms of credit scoring and personal privacy. 

3. **Violation of Privacy** : The exposure of my private information through this data breach is a clear violation of my privacy rights under both state and federal laws. When a consumer 's data is compromised, the consumer may have grounds to dispute the legitimacy of any resulting debts or collections that are reported based on this breach.

4. **Right to Dispute and Remove Inaccurate Information** : In light of these facts, I am exercising my right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to dispute the accuracy of this account.

Despite providing supporting documentation, Experian did not properly investigate the dispute, nor did they notify me of the results within the required 30-day period as mandated by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ). Additionally, the FTC requires credit reporting agencies to maintain accurate information, which Experian has failed to do in this case.

The account details are as follows : Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Background : In XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified of a data breach that compromised my personal information. Subsequently, I discovered that a XXXX XXXX XXXX account had been fraudulently opened in my name without my authorization. 
Upon identifying this unauthorized account, I promptly disputed its validity with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. Despite providing evidence of its fraudulent nature, all three credit bureaus have verified its legitimacy and continue to report it on my credit files. 
Alleged Violations : I believe the actions of the aforementioned credit bureaus constitute violations of federal law, specifically : 1. 15 U.S.C. 1692gValidation of Debts : This statute mandates that debt collectors provide proper debt validation upon request. The continued reporting of this unauthorized account suggests that the credit bureaus have not ensured that the debt was properly validated, especially considering the circumstances of identity theft.

2. 15 U.S.C. 1635 Right of Rescission : While this section primarily pertains to the right to rescind certain credit transactions, it underscores the necessity of clear and accurate credit agreements. The existence of a fraudulent account indicates a failure to uphold these standards. 
Request for CFPB Intervention : In light of the above, I respectfully request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : Investigate the verification processes employed by XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX concerning this disputed account. 
Ensure that the unauthorized XXXX XXXX XXXX account is immediately deleted from my credit reports. 
Review and address any systemic issues within these credit bureaus that may allow for inadequate verification of disputed accounts, especially in identity theft resulting from data breaches. 
I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take this matter seriously and take appropriate action to rectify the situation. 
Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( XXXX ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not.

Initially, XXXX XXXX, Vice President and Branch and Business Center Manager ( NMLS XXXX ), assured me that the account was successfully opened and in good standing. However, shortly after, XXXX XXXX contacted me again, stating that the account could not be opened. This abrupt reversal was perplexing and lacked a clear explanation. Despite my requests for a detailed reason, XXXX XXXX was unable to provide a satisfactory answer. 

I provided PNC with all the relevant campaign information they requested. Moreover, I was not aware that my personal credit would be checked, as this was not a personal account. I had previously held a campaign account with PNC in XXXX without such issues. XXXX XXXX later informed me that the decision came from "" higher up '' in the bank, which was contradictory in nature and caused my campaign to get off to a rocky and slow start.

Subsequently, I received another letter from PNC XXXX XXXX, indicating that information from credit bureaus had influenced their decision regarding my account. 

Contrary to XXXX XXXX 's earlier assertion that the account could not be opened, it became evident that the account was indeed active until XX/XX/XXXX.

Summary of the Issue : 1. Unauthorized Transactions : My Chime account was hacked, and unauthorized transactions totaling {$600.00} were made. I immediately reported this to Chime and cooperated fully in their investigation.

2. Denied Disputes : Chime denied my dispute without providing clear documentation or explanation of their decision, as required under Regulation E.

3. Refusal to Reopen the Claim : Despite Regulation Es requirements, Chime refuses to reopen my claim unless I provide new or additional information. This places an undue burden on me and is not a lawful prerequisite to reexamine their decision. 

4.Inappropriate Questions : Chimes disputes team asked me to specify the additional documentation I have, which I believe is an attempt to deter me from pursuing my claim further. I have never been asked this in previous claims.

Violations of Federal Law : Chimes actions violate multiple provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E : Failure to Investigate Properly ( 1005.11 ) : Chimes denial of my dispute suggests an incomplete investigation. The burden of proof lies with Chime, not the consumer, to demonstrate that the transactions were authorized. 
Failure to Provide Documentation : Regulation E requires the financial institution to provide the consumer with evidence supporting its denial. Chime has failed to do so.

Unlawful Refusal to Reopen Claims : Chime is requiring additional information to reopen a claim, which is not a legal obligation for the consumer.

Requested Resolution : I request the CFPBs intervention to ensure that Chime : 1. Immediately reopens my dispute and conducts a proper investigation into the unauthorized transactions.

2. Reverses the unauthorized charges and restores my account balance to XXXX.

3. Provides all documentation and explanations regarding the initial denial of my dispute.

When I still hadn't heard any response back, I tried to email to follow up on my application status. The response I received was to reach out again to my student loan servicer. I would call and try to get through but on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I was able to get through. I was told that they needed a self certifying letter for my income. I told them I would have gladly submitted that, earlier, had they let me know that it was needed. As always, I asked about the status of my account and they said it was good, they just needed that document. I decided I would submit it as soon as I got off of the phone, but because of the trouble I had getting through and the lack of communication I was receiving from XXXX, I requested a forbearance in addition to my Income Driven Repayment Plan, so I could be covered if there were any further delays. 
They approved it immediately and I uploaded the self- certification letter as soon as we ended the call. That night I received a notification from Experian that there was a score decrease. My score went from a XXXX to a XXXX over night. I was still in the process of disputing a different creditor that dropped my score from the XXXX 's. 
I have been filed disputes with Experian, written XXXX to reach out to their corporate office and have not had results. Eventually when I spoke with customer service again, they said that my account has never been in poor standing. They transferred my loan to a sister company XXXX XXXX XXXX  without my knowledge and my issue was with them. 
By the time I found out about XXXX XXXX XXXX, I'd already started the process of trying to have my loans forgiven because they qualified for it due the age and type of loan I had. My loans have never been in default or poor standing in 17 years so I was so worried that this recent error would hinder my forgiveness. 
When I reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX, to ask them to correct the error, they also said I didn't owe them anything and that I needed to call XXXX. Neither company has addressed the issue of the tank in my credit score, but because of my recent payment history with my other creditors, my score is approaching what it was before the error. With this error fixed, It will be where it should be which is in the late XXXX 's.

I have reason to believe that this account has been compromised due to identity theft and fraudulent activity, which I reported to Capital One but have not received adequate resolution or relief. 

To the best of my knowledge, I did not authorize the transactions leading to this debt. These charges appear to have been incurred without my consent, and I have already filed an identity theft report with the appropriate authorities. Despite providing evidence of fraudulent activity, Capital One has refused to forgive the debt or adequately address the compromised nature of the account. 

This is a sticky situation because it is hard to prove my identity theft on my own behalf because I did not make a police report and I did not realize I was a victim of identity theft up until months later after it took place. The capital one account has never been my main bank account/credit/debit card used. It was always my backup, but I mainly used another bank for all of my expenses and direct deposits whenever I am employed. The only course of action I took regarding the identity theft was notifying capital one when I did realize months after the account was already in debt and closed, locking my XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX a new social security XXXX XXXX the old XXXX as stolen ( there is no paper proof/documentation of this in my possession ). 

As I am currently unemployed, I am unable to settle this debt and am requesting your assistance in investigating this matter further to ensure my rights as a consumer are protected. I would appreciate any steps the CFPB can take to mediate or investigate this issue, as the debt has placed a significant financial burden on me through no fault of my own.

I was told by an employee with TD Bank that this was possibly, only for the next billing cycle to still reflect a balance. 

I called in and was then informed that I was told incorrectly, and that they could not clear one account, even though I paid exactly as the representative instructed me. I was told that I could request my money back, and the balance would go back to the promotional plan to continue payments I have been making for 2 years. 

Instead of this occurring, they then opened a revolving credit plan on my account without my consent, and charging 29.99 % interest on the money that should have went back to the promotional rate as agreed to by the company. This has been ongoing since XXXX, and I am being charged interest each month that I do not owe as a result. I have called continuously to try to have it resolved, sent in emails, tried to escalate to a supervisor or manager or director, all for no update on the account and absolutely no satisfaction. 

In XXXX, I was then sent to collections over the interest payments that are for the credit line that was opened without my consent. My credit score also took a hit of over XXXX points, all to a customer who never missed a payment and is still making payments to date for the amount I owe- {$380.00} per month. Their collections department then began calling me 4 times a day everyday, and I voiced the issue to everyone I spoke with only to be told they would let their manager know. I told them to listen to the calls between myself and their company as all calls are recorded, and they would be able to hear everything as it was presented to me as a customer, and they should be able to correct their errors. Nearly 4 months later, still no resolution. 


I have repeatedly told everyone I spoke with that I want to pay my debts, but opening a credit line without my consent and charging me interest on said credit line is unlawful. I want to pay what I owe, not what I do not. Please inquire regarding the correction of these errors, and issue a request they redaction to correct my credit score.

Credit reports constitute private property owned solely by the individuals whose financial data they represent. The unauthorized dissemination and utilization of this information violate property rights protected by the U.S. Constitution and relevant statutory laws.

This document outlines specific legal violations, including the unauthorized dissemination of private financial data, the misuse of credit reports without consent, and violations of constitutional property rights. It provides supporting evidence and demands immediate corrective actions by the agencies addressed herein.

KEY POINTS OF CONCERN 1. Credit Reports are Private Property Legal Basis : The personal identity, financial agreements, and transaction histories contained within credit reports are private property as defined under Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution.

The Supreme Courts decision in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), established that private property can not be taken or used without consent or just compensation.

Statutes at Large, Vol. 48, p. 112, further reinforces protections against the unlawful use of private property.

Violation : Credit reporting agencies and financial institutions have utilized and disseminated financial data without the explicit consent of the individual. This practice effectively appropriates private property for their gain.

Examples : Incorrect information on credit reports, such as accounts that do not belong to the complainant, is reported without verification.

Unauthorized inquiries from unknown sources are recorded without consent.

2. Unlawful Public Reporting Without Consent Legal Basis : Dissemination of financial information without the explicit consent of the individual is prohibited under statutory and constitutional protections.

Statutes at Large, Vol. 74, p. 451, outlines prohibitions against unauthorized data sharing and privacy violations.

Violation : The public and private sharing of personal financial information by credit reporting agencies without consent infringes on individuals right to privacy.

Examples : Incorrect personal information such as wrong dates of birth, addresses, or names is shared with third parties.

Improperly marked account statuses ( e.g., closed accounts shown as open ) cause harm to individuals ' reputations.

Their processor, XXXX, sent me a form to send to the mortgage company to fill out, but the majority of the mortgage companies tell me they will not fill out XXXXXXXX XXXX form - that they have their own form they send that is their verification of mortgage. I've been back and forth several times- requesting the XXXX - but Cornerstone First Mortgage says it is not what they need ( even though this came directly from the mortgage company and says on the form XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

This original process began with XXXX in XXXX, XXXX. Around XXXX, XXXX, the file was given to Cornerstone First Mortgage and they have been working on this since then. Cornerstone was supposed to refinance XXXX properties, but not XXXX has been closed and today is XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had a conversation - which is recorded- with XXXX and XXXX from Cornerstone First Mortgage. XXXX assured me that they were not 'starting from scratch ' but were just reviewing the documents to see what was missing in order to close these properties in a timely fashion. XXXX stated that a timely fashion would be XXXX to XXXX weeks, but we still have no closing dates set. 

I spoke with Cornerstone CEO XXXX XXXX tonight and he gave the same song and dance as XXXX and XXXX - that they need several more weeks to close the properties, even though they have supposedly been working on this since XXXX, XXXX. I gave them until Friday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX to get the properties closed, but XXXX XXXX said that was impossible. 

Cornerstone First Mortgage processors do not seem to know what they are doing. They continuously request documents and then 'lose ' them and request them again. Next, they say because it took so long to get documents, the ones they had that were fine are now expired ; so they request those documents again. It turns into a vicious cycle as they keep losing documents, claiming documents expired, and do not even look at emails for document requested that were sent multiple times from multiple sources ( email, fax, etc ). 

To go further, Cornerstone kept sending closing disclosures and the fees on these disclosures kept growing. XXXX stated that the fees at closing would be vastly less than what is on the disclosures, but after all I have been through - catching them in multiple lies - I did not trust them. I'm attaching the fees in question to show what they put on the disclosures.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Cornerstone First Mortgage, Inc.",TN,37388,,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-28,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11793968

I submitted my initial dispute on XX/XX/XXXX, along with a Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report and additional documentation supporting my claim. However, your agency has failed to meet its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Violations of the FCRA XXXX to XXXX a Reasonable Investigation ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ( a ) ( XXXX ) ) Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to conduct a reasonable investigation upon receiving a dispute. Despite providing a comprehensive FTC Identity Theft Report and detailed supporting evidence, I have not received confirmation of any substantive investigation into the disputed items. 
XXXX to Notify Me of Investigation Results ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ( a ) ( XXXX ) ) The FCRA mandates that consumers be notified of the results of an investigation within XXXX days of submitting a dispute. To date, I have not received any such notification, nor have I been informed of the outcome of your review or the process by which my dispute was evaluated. 
XXXXFailure to Block Inaccurate Information Promptly ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) The FCRA requires credit reporting agencies to block information resulting from identity theft upon receipt of appropriate documentation, such as an FTC Identity Theft Report. This has not occurred in my case. 

Precedent Cases Supporting My Position Your failure to comply with FCRA requirements is not only a violation of my rights but also exposes your agency to liability, as demonstrated in precedent cases : XXXX XXXX TransUnion XXXX ( XXXX ) : This case emphasized that credit reporting agencies have a duty to conduct reasonable investigations beyond relying on the data provided by furnishers. 

XXXX v. TransUnion LLC ( XXXX ) : The Supreme Court upheld consumer rights in disputes related to credit reporting inaccuracies, reinforcing the accountability of credit bureaus under the FCRA. 


Requested Resolution To resolve this matter, I demand the following actions : XXXXConduct a reasonable and thorough reinvestigation of the disputed accounts and transactions associated with my identity theft. 
XXXXProvide a detailed written summary of your investigation, including the steps taken and evidence reviewed. 
XXXXImmediately block or remove all inaccurate information resulting from the identity theft. 

If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaint by filing with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and potentially pursuing legal remedies.

I did not authorize any of the actions related to these accounts or inquiries, and I believe they represent a violation of my consumer rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section 605B, which addresses the blocking of information resulting from a data breach or fraud [ 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ], as well as Section 604, which covers permissible purposes for consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681b ]. 

Upon contacting the companies responsible for reporting these accounts, I found that these actions were initiated without proper validation or original proof from the reporting parties. As I never authorized these accounts or inquiries, they are not factual and must be considered a result of either a data breach or illegal reporting by creditors or third-party data furnishers.

These credit reporting agencies are unlawfully reporting charge-offs and other financial information on my credit report, which constitutes a violation of my rights under the Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C. 3401, as well as other federal consumer protection laws. 

It has come to my attention that XXXX and Equifax have been reporting charge-offs and related financial information that effectively disclose my personal income or financial standing without my explicit consent. Reporting such information is not only inaccurate and misleading, but it also violates my privacy rights. 

Under federal law, consumers have the right to control the dissemination of their personal financial information. The following laws are relevant to this complaint : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( b ) : The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must ensure the accuracy of the information they report and limits the use of consumer reports to permissible purposes only. I have not provided explicit consent for either XXXX or Equifax to report this personal financial information. 
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( b ) : The FDCPA prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of consumer information to third parties. By reporting my financial information without my consent, both XXXX and Equifax are in violation of this provision.

Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), 12 U.S.C. 5531 : The CFPA prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAPs ) by financial institutions. The unauthorized reporting of my personal financial information falls under unfair and abusive practices.

Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C. 3401 : This law protects consumers from the unauthorized disclosure of personal financial information. The actions of XXXX and Equifax violate this statute by reporting charge-offs that effectively disclose my financial status without my consent.

Details of My Complaint Both XXXX and Equifax have reported charge-offs and other financial data on my credit reports that disclose information about my personal financial standing. These entries are harmful to my credit profile, and I have never provided consent for this information to be collected or shared with third parties. This unauthorized reporting has negatively impacted my ability to obtain credit, employment, and housing. 

I have formally disputed these inaccurate items with both XXXX and Equifax, but they have failed to properly investigate and remove the disputed information. Instead, they continue to report this data, in violation of federal law. 

My Request to the CFPB I am requesting that the CFPB take immediate action to investigate the following violations by XXXX and Equifax : Improper reporting of charge-offs and financial information without consumer consent. 

Failure to conduct proper investigations of disputed items, as required by the FCRA. 
Violation of privacy rights under the Right to Financial Privacy Act. 

Furthermore, I request that the CFPB ensure that both XXXX and Equifax : Permanently remove any unauthorized or inaccurate financial information from my credit reports. 

Cease reporting charge-offs and other financial information that effectively disclose my personal income or financial status without my explicit consent. 

Provide me with a corrected credit report that reflects the removal of all unauthorized items.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,30331,,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-15,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,11515872

Despite my initial dispute filed on XX/XX/XXXX, the inaccuracies remain unresolved, causing continued harm and distress. 
The following violations have occurred in relation to this reporting : 1. Inaccurate Reporting of Late Payments : The student loan accounts were incorrectly reported with late payments during a period when the accounts were in deferment status, as documented and verified by the US Department of Education ( documentation available upon request ). The accounts should reflect a current status with no late payments. Specifically, the following dates have been inaccurately reported as late payments : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. Violation of Privacy and Unauthorized Reporting Under 15 USC 1681b, I retain the right to privacy regarding my personal financial information. Reporting these accounts with incorrect late payments without my consent constitutes a violation of my rights.

3. Failure to Maintain Accurate Reporting Under 15 USC 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate and complete consumer files. By continuing to report these inaccuracies after my first dispute, the credit bureaus have failed in their obligations. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The errors include late payments being reported for months when the accounts were in deferment. Specifically, there are instances of 90- and 120-day late payments listed on my credit reports for TransUnion and XXXX , despite the loans being in deferment as verified by the US Department of Education . These discrepancies have severely impacted my credit score and financial reputation.

Requested Action : Given the severity of these violations and the documented deferment status of my loans, I am formally requesting the immediate correction of these accounts from my consumer reports within 10 calendar days from the receipt of this complaint. The requested corrections include removing all late payments and ensuring the accounts reflect a current status with no delinquencies. Failure to resolve this matter will result in further escalation.

I have a USDA loan and I was impacted financially by Covid and was offered CARES forbearance by the lender. I was assured by their agents that once I was back to work and ready to pay that the payments that were skipped would be put back into the loan and I could resume my original payment. However, when my hardship ended and I attempted to resume payments I was told that I had to go through a process to be approved for a plan to address the past due payments. No one told me that I had to be approved for a plan to address the past due payments, I was told not to worry about it, we will work something out once the pandemic ends and you are back at work. Due to these misrepresentations by Lakeview, I now find myself past due over {$65000.00} and in the beginning of the foreclosure process. I have been able to make my payment since XXXX but instead of working with me towards a resolution I have been stuck in an endless circus of document submission, document review, lost documents, additional information needed etc. This process is disorganized and grueling and each time took several months, and each time I tried to get this resolved I have been denied. I am told that the only resolution is full reinstatement of the past due amount of {$65000.00} which is not possible. Lakeview misled me as to how this program worked and have failed to follow the guidelines and have engaged in unethical servicing practices relating to my USDA loan My ex-husband XXXX and I purchased our home in XXXX with a USDA Loan. I have worked for the state of Connecticut in the Department of XXXX XXXX for 13 years. When the pandemic hit in spring of XXXX my income was impacted as my hours were cut and since my kids were out of school I also had to stay home periodically to help with that also. When I contacted Lakeview in XXXX XXXX I was told that I was approved for forbearance and the missed payments would get put onto the end of the loan once I was able to resume the payments. In early XXXX I contacted them and said I was back on my feet and wanted to resume payments but was told that I needed to go through a review to see if I qualify for recapitalization. This had never been mentioned before, that I needed to qualify. I was a single mother who was back to work and ready to pay but instead I had to turn in all of my financial information over and over again, an endless stream of documents sent, documents lost, documents outdated and multiple applications. This was very frustrating because I kept applying over and over and kept being told that I was denied for assistance options and that I needed to reinstate the past due balance. Since that time I have been trying to get help but feel that I am spinning my wheels as XXXX XXXX pushes me into foreclosure. 

My delinquency was due to XXXX and I was approved for the government backed CARES forbearance and Lakeview is required to give me the opportunity to go into a plan to address the past due amount. I have remarried and my new husband works and contributes to our income. My financial circumstances have significantly changed. Additionally I have 40 % of the arrearages amount set aside to submit as a good faith payment. USDA guidelines allow for the servicer to combine multiple programs in order to offer a solution and XXXX XXXX has failed to do so. If I brought in {$25000.00} towards the arrearages a portion of the loan could be deferred and a portion could be modified with the change in financial circumstances.

Furthermore, I have learned that Experian, one of the major credit reporting agencies, has failed to implement basic matching tools designed to prevent or significantly reduce the likelihood of reinsertion by a new furnisher of a previously deleted tradeline. This oversight has resulted in Experian not to delete information without proper certification, notification, or consumer recourse. 

Specifically, Experian has not implemented procedures to : Compare dates of first delinquencies Verify recent credit balance amounts Confirm high credit balances A signed contract or agreement between myself and XXXX XXXX XXXX that confirms my liability for the debt. 
An itemized statement or account history that outlines the specific transactions and activities related to this debt. 
Proof of any communication from me acknowledging the debt or agreeing to be responsible for it. 

As a result, consumers like myself who have disputed the accuracy of an account and believed their consumer report had been corrected are instead faced with the same inaccurate information reappearing on their consumer report without explanation under the name of a new furnisher. 

I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter and take necessary actions to ensure that Experian and other credit reporting agencies implement adequate procedures to prevent the reinsertion of previously deleted tradelines and protect consumers ' rights.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,DC,20032,,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11679114

2025-03-03,Debt collection,Other debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"Request that Monterrey Financial Services send/answer the following : XXXX Residences isnt a US company XXXX but in XXXX. 

I am very deeply concerned about the unethical and deceptive practices being used in the sale of timeshare memberships in XXXX to XXXX citizens. 
Companies like XXXX are engaging in fraudulent tactics, including making false or misleading statements about the benefits, costs, and availability of timeshare properties. These deceptive practices are often designed to create a false sense of urgency or to mislead consumers into making financial commitments they do not fully understand. 
Furthermore, companies like XXXX are using manipulative tactics such as serving alcohol to potential buyers in an attempt to influence their decision-making and close deals under pressure. 
This unethical approach takes advantage of vulnerable consumers, like myself, leading us to sign contracts without fully comprehending the long-term financial obligations or the true nature of the product they are purchasing. 
We asked direct questions and was told we could just walk away if we no longer wanted the timeshare as our social security numbers were not attached.. 

More XXXX citizens are raising this concern to call on both XXXX and XXXX authorities to investigate and take action against companies using deceptive practices, including false advertising and coercion through alcohol, to manipulate consumers into purchasing timeshares. 

Please provide the following : *Send debt validation letter *Payment History on Account *Send documentation with the original signature *Has there been any insurance claim filed on this debt? 
*See the chain of title to collect on this debt My family and I were deceived and lied to. 

During a timeshare presentation, it is illegal for companies to mislead or deceive consumers with false promises or misleading information. 

Under XXXX law, particularly the Timeshare Resale Accountability Act and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) regulations, deceptive practices in the sale of timeshares are prohibited. These laws require that all marketing materials, contracts, and sales pitches be truthful and accurate. 
Any attempt to coerce, mislead, or misrepresent the benefits or terms of a timeshare agreement is a violation of consumer protection laws. 

Additionally, as consumers, we trust international companies selling timeshares or memberships to prioritize our safety, especially when purchasing property abroad. When we invest in timeshares, we do so with the expectation that the companies involved will take every measure to ensure a safe and secure environment for us to enjoy our vacations and investments. Unfortunately, recent developments have raised significant concerns about the safety of XXXX citizens traveling to XXXX. 
Between XXXX and XXXX, there was a disturbing increase in the number of murders ( over XXXX ) and violent crimes involving XXXX citizens in XXXX. 
These tragic events have understandably caused many consumers, like myself, to reconsider our decisions to purchase timeshare memberships in the region. 
As we weigh the risks, the rise in XXXX calls into question whether the companies offering timeshares are doing enough to ensure the security of their clients in an increasingly volatile environment. 
Given this situation, we as consumers XXXX find it necessary to reconsider or even seek to exit timeshare contracts. 

Reasons we are wanting to terminate this membership/timeshare agreement in addition to deceptive pitch and fraudulent/deceptive practices include : XXXX. Increased Safety Risks : The surge in XXXX against XXXX citizens in XXXX makes it difficult to justify vacationing or investing in properties located in areas where security is a growing concern. If the timeshare company can not guarantee a safe environment or provide enhanced security measures, clients XXXX no longer feel comfortable or secure using their membership. 
As a result, I urgeCFPB, FCC and like companies to hold international timeshare companies accountable. And, companies like XXXX to also protect XXXX citizens from companies like this. 


I further request that relevant communication be sent to my email regarding this debt. Again, the cease and desist was specifically around calling me about the debt. 

I will continue to challenge this debt as it was completely misleading, deceptive and fraudulent, purposely.

Despite my repeated efforts and the evidence I provided, Experian has neither corrected nor removed the disputed items, which remain inaccurate or unverifiable. This failure has negatively impacted my credit standing and caused ongoing financial harm.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), Experian is required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information within 30 days. Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure maximum possible accuracy in consumer credit files. Experians failure to properly investigate my disputes and its refusal to correct or remove inaccurate accounts constitute clear violations of these legal provisions.

Furthermore, I would like to bring attention to the recent CFPB lawsuit against Experian, which highlights systemic issues within its dispute resolution process. The lawsuit alleges that Experian has : 1. Failed to forward consumer-provided evidence to furnishers.

2. Accepted unreliable responses from furnishers without proper validation.

3. Failed to adequately notify consumers about the outcomes of their disputes.

These allegations mirror my experience. Experian has not properly reviewed or addressed the documentation I submitted, has failed to provide detailed explanations regarding its dispute resolutions, and has ultimately refused to take corrective action. This negligence continues to harm my financial standing, limiting my ability to obtain credit under fair terms.


Requested Action : I respectfully request that the CFPB take immediate action to : 1. Investigate Experians failure to comply with FCRA dispute resolution requirements. 2. Require Experian to correct or remove the disputed accounts from my credit report. 3. Ensure that Experian improves its dispute handling process to prevent further harm to consumers. Experians noncompliance with federal law has directly affected my financial stability, and I urge the CFPB to intervene promptly.

2025-02-13,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I respectfully submit this urgent request for immediate intervention regarding ongoing and unlawful foreclosure proceedings against my property at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX IL XXXX, despite clear evidence that the mortgage debt has been fully satisfied. The imminent sale of my home is scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, through XXXX, a sale that must be immediately stayed to prevent irreparable harm. 
I am the defendant in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, in Illinois, presided over by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Additionally, I have filed XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX to address numerous violations of my constitutional rights and federal law. Despite the submission of a Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/XXXX, which was recorded on my XXXX Financing Statement and privately served open ended GSA Bond to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, to settle the foreclosure case, the court has failed to honor the BOE and GSA Bonds and continues to allow the foreclosure to proceed unlawfully. 
Factual Background On XX/XX/XXXX, I issued a Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) to the U.S. Treasury in satisfaction of the alleged mortgage debt associated with my property. This BOE was validly recorded on my XXXX Financing Statement, pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ), which recognizes the BOE as a valid negotiable instrument under UCC 3-104 and 3-603. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, The GSA Bond was delivered in a private capacity toXX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX XXXX, who presides over the foreclosure case in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Case No. XXXX, through XXXX, Manager of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who confirmed on video that he personally delivered the instrument to XX/XX/XXXXXXXX. 
Despite being given 90 days to respond and comply, XXXX XXXX has remained silent, which under UCC 3-501 ( a ) constitutes acceptance of the instrument. Instead of applying the BOE to discharge the debt, the court continues to pursue foreclosure proceedings. 
The GSA Bond was open-ended, allowing XXXX XXXX to input any amount necessary to fully satisfy and discharge the alleged debt. 

Despite being given 90 days to comply, XXXX XXXX has failed to apply the bond or acknowledge it in any manner, constituting tacit acquiescence and acceptance of the bond. 

Instead of resolving the matter, the foreclosure case has been allowed to proceed, and a foreclosure sale is scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, which is now listed on XX/XX/XXXX 

The bonds purpose was to fully satisfy the debt, close the foreclosure case, and protect Petitioners home located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Illinois XXXX. 
Legal Arguments 1. Violation of Due Process U.S. Constitution, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments The foreclosure proceedings have systematically denied me due process. My requests for discovery have been denied, my evidence has been ignored, and I have been prevented from presenting my case in a meaningful way. These actions violate my constitutional right to due process and fair treatment under the law. 
2. Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) Satisfaction and Discharge of Debt UCC 3-104 establishes that a Bill of Exchange is a negotiable instrument.

UCC 3-603 ( b ) mandates that once such an instrument is tendered and not refused within a reasonable time, the underlying obligation is discharged. Judge Sullivans failure to reject or acknowledge the BOE constitutes acceptance by silence.

UCC 3-501 ( a ) confirms that an instrument must be dishonored or accepted, but the judges silence and subsequent actions indicate unlawful retention without discharge of the debt.

3. Federal Consumer Protection Statutes Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. : Failure to provide validation of debt and misapplication of payments are violations of TILA.

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692 : Continuation of collection efforts after payment and failure to verify the debt constitute deceptive and unfair practices.

28 U.S.C. 1331 Federal question jurisdiction exists as Petitioners claims arise under the Constitution and federal statutes.

28 U.S.C. 1343 Federal courts have authority to redress constitutional violations and grant equitable relief.

42 U.S.C. 1983 The state courts failure to honor the GSA Bond and the continued foreclosure proceedings constitute violations of Petitioners civil rights under color of state law.

4. Illinois Foreclosure Law Violations 735 ILCS 5/15-1508 ( d ) requires that foreclosure sales be fair and just. Proceeding with a sale while the debt has already been discharged violates this statute.

Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 ILCS 505/2 : The foreclosure proceedings represent unfair and deceptive practices.

5. Humanitarian and International Law The imminent eviction of my family of six without legal justification violates basic human rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( Articles 17 and 25 ), which guarantee the right to property and an adequate standard of living.

________________________________________ Relief Requested Given the urgency of this situation, I respectfully request that the CFPB : 1. Immediately halt the XX/XX/XXXX foreclosure sale of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX IL XXXX. 
2. Order XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to acknowledge and account for the bond. 
3. Enforce the acceptance and application of the open-ended GSA Bond served on XX/XX/XXXX, to satisfy the alleged debt in Case No. XXXX. 
4. Conduct an investigation into the actions of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and all other parties involved in this unlawful foreclosure. 
5. Enforce the application of the Bill of Exchange and confirm the discharge of the alleged debt.

6. Protect my family from homelessness and uphold our constitutional and human rights.

Conclusion I have exhausted all remedies available at the state level and am now at my last line of defense. This situation is urgent, and immediate intervention is required to prevent a miscarriage of justice.

2025-01-13,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","Subject : Mortgage Payment Error and Unfair Late Fees Complaint Summary : I recently discovered that my mortgage was placed in default due to a short payment, which I was unaware of for two months. Despite having paid a total of {$5900.00} by XXXX, the bank refused to apply my payments to the mortgage account because of a shortfall of {$580.00} in XXXX. This shortfall was related to the escrow account reserve for taxes, not the actual interest payment. The bank has now demanded {$24000.00} in late fees and refuses to accept further payments unless the late fees are paid in full. 

Details of the Issue : Payment Application Issue : By XXXX, I had already paid {$5900.00}. Even if my XXXX payment was short by {$580.00}, the payment should have been applied to the mortgage account. The unpaid amount was not related to interest but to the escrow account reserve for property taxes. Despite this, the bank treated the shortfall as if it was a missed mortgage payment and escalated the situation unnecessarily. If penalties were applied starting from XXXX based on a {$1300.00} shortfall ( from both XXXX and XXXX ), it is unreasonable to demand {$24000.00} in penalties for such a small deficit. 

Excessive Late Fees : A penalty of {$24000.00} for a shortfall of {$1300.00} is excessive and disproportionate. The penalty calculation appears arbitrary, and there has been no clear explanation or breakdown of how this amount was determined. 

Refusal to Accept Payments : The bank is refusing to accept further payments until the full penalty amount is paid. This has escalated the issue unnecessarily and has caused significant financial distress. 

Requested Resolution : Apply the {$5900.00} paid to the mortgage account and adjust or waive the excessive late fees. 
Allow me to resume regular payments to bring the mortgage current. 
Provide a detailed breakdown of how the {$24000.00} penalty was calculated and clarify why the escrow reserve shortfall was treated as a missed payment.

As a consumer relying on accurate credit information, I was dismayed to discover that Experian failed to notify me regarding reinstated information that was previously deleted from my credit report. 
According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), consumers are entitled to timely and accurate information on their credit reports. It has come to my attention that certain information that was initially deleted from my credit report has been reinstated without any prior notification from Experian. 
This lack of notification not only violates the provisions set forth by the FCRA but also hinders my ability to monitor and understand the information being reported on my credit profile. Transparency and communication are paramount in matters concerning credit reporting, and the failure to notify me of such reinstated information has caused undue confusion and concern. 
I am request that Experian promptly rectify this situation by providing me with detailed information regarding the reinstated data on my credit report. Additionally, I urge Experian to ensure that such oversights do not occur in the future, and that proper notification procedures are strictly adhered to in accordance with the FCRA guidelines.

Despite this, the accounts in question are still being reported on my credit report, which I believe violates my rights under the FDCPA and possibly the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

The accounts are inaccurate and should not be included on my credit report. I have taken the following actions : Sent the cease and desist letter on XXXX via certified mail to ensure receipt. 
Included specific disputes about the accounts and provided all necessary supporting documentation. 
To date, these accounts remain on my credit report, which has caused continued harm to my credit standing and financial well-being. I believe this is a violation of both my right to have accurate credit reporting and to limit communications about disputed debts.

Legal Basis for Dispute 1. Inaccuracy of Reported Information Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information they report. Because the source of this information, XXXX, no longer maintains these records, Experian is reporting inaccurate and incomplete information by continuing to include these items on my credit report. 

2. Obligation to Remove Information FCRA 605 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) requires the removal of inaccurate items from the credit report within 4 days of a dispute being submitted. Given that these records are demonstrably inaccurate, Experian 's failure to promptly remove them violates this statutory obligation.

3. Willful Noncompliance Under 15 U.S.C. 1681n, Experian is liable for willful noncompliance with the FCRA. This includes failing to conduct a reasonable investigation into the accuracy of the disputed items and failing to act in accordance with the law to ensure only verified and accurate information remains on my credit report. 

Demand for Resolution I demand that the following actions be taken immediately : The removal of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) from my Experian credit report within the time frame required by FCRA 605 ( b ).

Confirmation from Experian that these items have been removed, along with a revised copy of my credit report reflecting these changes.

2025-01-27,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Private mortgage insurance (PMI),I purchased a home in XXXX of XXXX and sold my current home. Once my current home sold I applied the funds received toward my new mortgage in the form of a recast to lower my payment and remove the PMI. My mortgage has been sold and transferred to different servicing agencies more than once. My original loan servicer agreed to remove the PMI and lowered my payment. My loan was transferred to another servicing company and the PMI was still being taken from my escrow account. I called and they agreed to remove the PMI again and lowered my payment. I also sent a letter asking for an investigation into my account for all the hassle it took for me to have this simple process done after calling multiple times without success. They sent a letter stating they received my letter and would look into it. I received another letter asking for more time to investigate. I have been transferred multiple times and have a hard time speaking to a supervisor. I received a letter recently stating my loan was being transferred to another servicing company as of XX/XX/XXXX. I called today and was on the phone for two hours with no success on the refund to my escrow of the PMI that was taken in error. One service agent admitted she saw a note in my account that the escrow was taken in error and was going to be refunded. She said the note was from XXXX but it said that it was in process still. She told me I need to speak with the insurance department. The insurance department said I needed to speak with customer service. I was transferred to customer service and the young man would not listen to me and was talking over me. I asked for a supervisor and she did the same although I am not certain she was actually a supervisor. I asked for a call from a supervisor and she said if the dont call in the next couple days to just call back. It is extremely difficult to get a service agent on the line so this is very frustrating after two hours on the phone with no success. My loan will service will change again as of XX/XX/XXXX and I am afraid I will need to still fight with the new company. My escrow will be short from this error because they lowered the payment twice. One from the old company and one with this company but still took the PMI payments from the escrow. Most agents I talk to are rude and will not help. I ask for a supervisor and am told I will have to wait for a call and if they dont call to call again. Calling and trying to get an agent is almost impossible as the phone system does not work correctly.

I urge the CFPB to take immediate action to investigate these matters and compel XXXX, Experian, and XXXX to correct the inaccurate information on my credit report, specifically regarding the XXXX XXXX  XXXX account, account number XXXX.

Despite my efforts to resolve these issues by sending multiple letters to the credit reporting agencies, I have yet to receive a satisfactory response or resolution. These inaccuracies not only affect my creditworthiness but also represent a significant source of stress and concern.

2. Variations of my name that do not accurately reflect my legal name.

3. Outdated addresses that should no longer be associated with my credit report.

I believe that these errors may be contributing to a negative impact on my credit score and overall financial history. I kindly request your support in facilitating the correction of these inaccuracies and in assisting me with the removal of the unauthorized inquiries.

On XX/XX/year>, I disputed the reporting of my XXXX XXXX  account, citing incorrect payment information. Within less than 10 hours, Experian issued a response acknowledging that the account was inaccurately reported but stated that it would not be removed or corrected.

The response provided by Experian reads as follows : The incorrect account with XXXX XXXX  that starts with XXXX has not been changed and will remain on your credit report. 

This swift response strongly suggests that Experian did not conduct a thorough investigation, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Specifically : 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation ( FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ) : Experians response timeframe raises concerns about whether XXXX XXXX  was contacted to verify the reported information.

The account has already been acknowledged as containing errors, yet Experian has refused to correct or remove the inaccuracies.

2. Failure to Correct or Delete Inaccurate Information ( FCRA Section 623 ( b ) ) : By law, credit reporting agencies must delete or correct inaccurate information if it can not be verified as accurate.

Actions Requested : I respectfully request the CFPBs assistance in ensuring Experian complies with the FCRA by : 1. Conducting a proper investigation into this accounts payment reporting errors.

2. Providing clear and verifiable documentation from XXXX XXXX to substantiate the payment history.

3. Correcting or removing the account from my credit report if it can not be verified as accurate and complete.

Supporting Documentation : A copy of Experians response ( Report Number : XXXX ). 
A copy of my credit report showing the disputed account and errors.

Desired Outcome : I request that the CFPB hold Experian accountable for its obligations under the FCRA and ensure that this matter is resolved promptly. Experians failure to address this issue impacts my creditworthiness and creates unnecessary financial hardship.

I have never conducted business with nor entered into any contractual agreement with LVNV FUNDING LLC. Consequently, any claim against me by this entity is without merit. Furthermore, transferring a security or obligation does not confer rights to the transferee that supersede those of the original creditor. Under Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) Section 3-203, the rights of enforcement are limited to the transferor and do not extend to third parties unless certain legal conditions are met : Instrument Transfer : According to UCC 3-203 ( a ), an instrument is considered transferred only when it is delivered by a party other than its issuer for enforcement purposes.

Transferee Rights : Per UCC 3-203 ( b ), the transferee acquires only the rights held by the transferor and can not attain holder-in-due-course status if fraud or illegality is involved. 

Endorsement Requirements : UCC 3-203 ( c ) specifies that a transferee must have a specifically enforceable right to the transferor 's endorsement, and negotiation is incomplete without such endorsement. 

Partial Transfers : UCC 3-203 ( d ) states that a transferee of less than the entire instrument has no enforceable rights under the UCC and holds only partial assignment rights. 

Based on the aforementioned statutes, LVNV FUNDING LLC has no legal standing to pursue or report any obligations tied to my name. I demand the immediate removal of any information related to this matter from my credit file and confirmation of this action in writing within 15 days. 

Failure to comply with this request will compel me to file complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and other relevant authorities. Additionally, I reserve the right to pursue legal action for any damages arising from the unauthorized use of my information.

I made a {$500.00} down payment, and the original loan amount was {$20000.00}, with a high annual percentage rate ( APR ) of 21.84 %. My monthly payment is {$510.00}. 

Since the start of the loan, I have paid {$9900.00} toward the balance, but I still owe {$11000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. The current estimated value of the vehicle is {$6100.00}, leaving me in a significant negative equity position. 

When I contacted Santander Consumer USA to inquire about refinancing or modifying the loan to make the payments more manageable, I was told that refinancing was not an option through them. This has left me with no ability to adjust the terms of my loan despite the financial burden caused by the high interest rate and the gap between the loan balance and the vehicles value. 

I believe the loan terms were predatory, as the excessive interest rate and risk of negative equity were not adequately explained at the time of purchase. Additionally, I am concerned that neither XXXX nor Santander Consumer USA conducted a thorough assessment of my ability to repay the loan under such unfavorable terms.",,"SANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.",CA,92394,,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-13,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11498188
2025-01-28,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate and misleading information contained in my credit report, as well as to address your companys failure to comply with federal consumer protection laws. This dispute is in direct reference to the recent enforcement action taken by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) against Experian for engaging in sham investigations and failing to properly address consumer disputes.

It is unacceptable that Experian, as one of the largest credit reporting agencies, continues to violate the rights of consumers under federal law. I demand that you immediately investigate and correct the inaccuracies in my credit report and provide a detailed explanation of your findings. Failure to do so will result in further action, including filing a complaint with the CFPB and pursuing legal remedies.

Below, I cite three key federal laws under **15 U.S.C . ** that Experian is legally obligated to comply with : 1. **15 U.S.C. 1681c Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section 605** This section mandates that outdated and inaccurate information must not be included in consumer credit reports. Experians failure to remove or correct such information violates this provision and harms my creditworthiness.

2. **15 U.S.C. 1681e Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section 607** This section requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer reports. Experians sham investigations and failure to properly address disputes demonstrate a blatant disregard for this legal obligation.

3. **15 U.S.C. 1681i Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section 611** This section requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information within 30 days of receiving a dispute. Experians pattern of conducting inadequate or sham investigations, as highlighted by the CFPBs enforcement action, is a clear violation of this law.

I demand that Experian : 1. Conduct a thorough and lawful reinvestigation of all disputed items on my credit report.

2. Provide me with written confirmation of the results of the reinvestigation, including any corrections made.

3. Remove any inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information from my credit report.

4. Cease any practices that violate federal consumer protection laws, including sham investigations.

If Experian fails to comply with these demands within 30 days of receiving this, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter by pursuing legal action under the FCRA. I will also seek damages for any harm caused to my creditworthiness and financial well-being as a result of Experians negligence and noncompliance.

This letter serves as a formal notice of my dispute and a demand for immediate action. I expect Experian to uphold its legal obligations and protect my rights as a consumer.

I believe these late payments are erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history. 

Account name : XXXX XXXX Account number XXXX Nature of the Complaint : 1. Inaccurate Reporting : The late payments listed on my credit report are inaccurate. I have consistently made my payments on time, as I have been enrolled in autopay for all my accounts.

2. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FC

RA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness. 3. Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The r
eporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

4. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files.

Furthermore, under the FCRA, articles 616 and 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o ) outline the civil liability for willful and negligent noncompliance, respectively.

Requested Resolution : I request that Experian conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payments from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments.

I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of these entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer.

I have recently reviewed my credit report and identified several hard inquiries that I believe were made in violation of my rights, and I seek your intervention in addressing these issues. The following items I would like to have removed : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX According to the FCRA ( Section 604 ), a credit inquiry is considered "" hard '' when it is made as a result of a credit application, loan request, or any other action that may impact my credit score. Under the FCRA, these inquiries should only be recorded if I have authorized them. Unfortunately, I believe some of the inquiries on my credit report were made without my explicit permission or were based on incomplete or inaccurate information. 

In particular, I would like to highlight the following reasons for my request : Lack of Authorization : There are hard inquiries on my credit report that I do not recall authorizing. If these inquiries were made without my consent, they violate my rights under the FCRA. 

Inaccurate Reporting : Some of the inquiries on my credit report may be inaccurate, as I did not apply for credit with the entities listed, or the inquiries may have been made in error. As per CFPB regulations, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of information contained within credit reports ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ).

Time Frame for Removal : Hard inquiries must be removed from a credit report after two years, but the inquiry may no longer be relevant to my credit score after the first year. I request that any outdated inquiries be removed as per CFPB regulations for data accuracy and fairness. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I understand that I have the right to dispute any inaccuracies on my credit report directly with the credit bureaus. However, due to the circumstances surrounding these inquiries and the fact that they are affecting my creditworthiness, I request that you investigate this matter thoroughly and remove any unauthorized or incorrect hard inquiries from my report in accordance with federal law. 

Please let me know if additional documentation or information is needed to support my request. I would greatly appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your response.

Two separate mailings were sent in XXXX and in XXXX to the address provided on the forms downloaded from the Marcus website ; however, these were returned as undeliverable in XXXX. In XXXX, I contacted customer service to report the death of my step-father and submitted a copy of the death certificate. 
After following up with customer service regarding the status of my request in XXXX, I was advised to resubmit the necessary documents, including an original or certified copy ( with a certified stamp ) of the XXXX of Attorney form. I was unable to send the original copy ( as I needed to retain it for other purposes ), I sought a notary to certify a copy of the document. I was subsequently advised that notaries do not provide certified stamps on copies, and instead arranged for the notary to stamp an Oath of Verification and Affirmation form to verify the authenticity of the document. 
In XXXX, I followed up with customer service and was informed that the packet had been received, but it was missing a stamp on the Oath of Verification and Affirmation form ( although the one I sent included a stamp ).

A fourth packet was sent in XXXX, and in an XXXX follow-up call, I was notified that the packet had been declined for all ten of my parents accounts due to a missing digit in the number of a single account.

Subsequent to this, I requested that my attorney take over the process of securing my recognition as the power of attorney.

2022-07-02,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"Good Evening, Today on XX/XX/2022 at approximately XXXX I received a call from a XXXX XXXX XXXX fictitious individual ) claiming to be a representative from PNC Bank . This fictitious individual called from the PNC Bank number XXXX. I asked the reason for his call and he stated that my account was compromised as two suspicious transactions had occurred on Thursday XX/XX/2022 approximately at XXXX in the amount of {$1000.00} and immediately thereafter at approximately XXXX on the same date another transaction of {$1500.00} was withdrawn. XXXX XXXX ( who he referred himself as ) stated that his badge number was XXXX. He asked if I knew anyone from XXXX, Illinois and I told him I did not. He went on to state, that in order to recover my funds I would need to log onto my PNC online banking account. I told him that I was proceeding to travel to my local PNC branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; XXXX, PA XXXX. 

The fraudster tells the member they will receive a text containing details of a XXXX transfer and I must authorize the transaction under the guise that it is for reversing the fraudulent debit card transaction ( s ). He called me back at approximately XXXX to inquire if I was able to log onto my online banking account as I had difficulty given I don't use this feature. He provided me with 10-digit reference code submitted via text at number XXXX at approximately XXXX ( please refer to attachment PNC Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Code : XXXX ). In doing so, {$1000.00} was transferred to a "" XXXX XXXX. '' The XXXX XXXX is shown as complete. He proceeded in telling me that I needed to transfer the {$1500.00} but could not do so when it had exceeded the limit and the transactions of {$420.00} left in my checking account had failed as I had reached the limit ( please refer to the attachment of XXXX activity ). 

While in route to my bank at the branch addressed mentioned above I realized this was a fraudster/scammer as I tried to call the number back which is indeed a accurate number given it is inputted in my contacts when I do in fact call PNC Bank ( please refer to the attachment of call log activity of when the scammer called-approximately time XXXX length of call XXXX minutes and XXXX seconds ). 

At approximately XXXX I met with XXXX XXXX XXXX Branch Banker ) XXXX  ID XXXX ) Number : XXXX at PNC Bank located at XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX PA XXXX ( please refer to her business card as attached ). I advised her of the aforementioned and also sent her an email ( please refer to email to XXXX XXXX attached ) of the text message of the 10-digit confirmation number. XXXX XXXX along with another banker reported that other PNC Bank consumers were negatively affected by this XXXX scam. XXXX XXXX had worked to close out my original debit card and provided me with a new card and pin number. She advised me to log into my online banking account and change my password which I complied. She insisted that she could not stop the {$1000.00} transaction as it had not posted to my account which I did not understand given I had immediately warned the financial institution while the transaction was still pending. I thought being proactive opposed to reactive would remedy the situation along with having to work to change my debit card information. 

XXXX XXXX insisted that I contact the bank tomorrow morning Saturday XX/XX/XXXX at the number on the back of my card the same number where all this fraudulent activity began XXXX to inquire if the transaction had posted in order to dispute it. I really did not feel comfortable, was uneasy, and untrusting. With {$1000.00} being removed from my account I needed answers immediately. So I contacted the number the same day XX/XX/XXXX after meeting with XXXX XXXX twice once at XXXX length of call XXXX minutes and XXXX seconds ( see attached call log activity ) spoke with XXXX representative and called again at approximately XXXX and XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX for approximately XXXX minutes. XXXX kindly advised me the same as XXXX XXXX stated prior. XXXX XXXX stated that she was notating this matter as fraud and to reach out tomorrow morning to dispute the transaction once posted. I contacted XXXX directly at XXXX at approximately XXXX today for a duration of XXXX minutes and XXXX seconds ( see attached call log ). XXXX stated that they could not assist as the matter needed to be resolved with PNC Bank directly. 

I have never been involved any fraudulent behavior as such. I thought me being proactive opposed to reactive would have allowed PNC to stop payment to prevent having to file a dispute or funds to be transferred. I have to put my faith in the hands of others to hopefully pray that all of my funds can be recovered. It should be noted that I filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( please refer to attachment ) for this matter. Please help me and thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

2025-01-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,""" The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. 

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of TILA US Code 1666B since I was never late. 

I recently reviewed my consumer report and noticed an incorrect late payment record on my XXXX Bank account [ XXXX ]. I have always maintained timely payments on this account. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), creditors are required to accurately report consumer transactions and provide a mechanism for correcting errors in a timely manner. Please conduct an investigation into this matter, and if you can not provide documentary evidence of these supposed late payments, I demand these payments to be updated to on time as they should be as I was NEVER late. I expect these updates to be made promptly, in compliance with the law.

XX/XX/XXXX, Mr. Cooper 's bankruptcy 's dept rep specificly told me they do not object to receiving fund from the XXXX program or any HAF programs and asked me to obtain a letter from my bankruptcy attorney agreeing to their participation of the XXXX program, to support Mr. Cooper 's acceptance of the XXXX program. Mr. Cooper promised to correct their error by sending a letter to XXXX specificly stating that they "" did not '' object to the XXXX program and will participate with receiving funds. 

I regularly sent emails and follow up calls during ( XXXX XXXX ) to ensure that Mr. Cooper made good on their promise to remediate their error. Unfortunately I was disappointed to know that the specific letter Mr. Cooper promised to send was never sent to XXXX and XXXX stated that as of XX/XX/XXXX, I was denied the XXXX program because Mr. Cooper failed to send XXXX the coorespondance to overturn the objection that was inadvertently was sent error, as promised to me. ( recorded calls are available ) As of today Mr. Cooper has stated that they are trying to remediate the problem they created in XXXX and that I am now to contact XXXX not Mr. Cooper for status on the XXXX status. 

Mr. Cooper 's negligence, admitted error, failure to resolve timely ( timeline XXXX - XXXX ), and significant impact to jeopardizing my receipt of state assistance during my hardship is unacceptable, I also believe their actions maybe discriminatory and the process has been extremely exhausting and stressful for me and my family. 

I am requesting an investigation of Mr. Cooper 's actions and remediation with a desired outcome to compensate me the amount of funds I would receive from the XXXX program as described in the "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' as listed above. 

I must state that I have spoken with over 10 representatives over the past 5 months from Mr. Cooper all on recorded lines and have also sent written correspondence. All have confirmation that Mr. Cooper never objected to my participation in the XXXX program and they would resolve within 7 days. 

Everytime I would ask a rep when would the letter confirming Mr. Cooper 's participation/acceptance would be sent to XXXX, to resolve Mr. Cooper 's error the response was always "" a letter will be sent within 7 days. '' I have been told that a letter will be sent within 7 days since XX/XX/XXXX. I have diligently followed with Mr. Cooper and XXXX up every 2 weeks since then. I am now being told to just wait and follow up with NJFMA with questions regarding the XXXX decision. This is unfair because the XXXX decision is based on the service 's response. 

How can this be when the error was with Mr. Cooper. More importantly I am very concerned that I am in jeopardy of loosing my XXXX XXXX and Mr. Cooper is demonstrating unfair Mortgage practice.

I am seeking clarification on the legality of reducing a credit limit to an amount below the current balance, especially when such an action causes severe harm to my financial standing. Additionally, my minimum payment has unexpectedly increased from {$83.00} to {$7000.00}, which appears both unreasonable and potentially unlawful.

Upon reviewing my reports, I noticed a significant error related to my CBNA account ( Account Number XXXX ). 
Specific Inaccuracy : The report states that the account was charged off with a past due amount of {$6100.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX and a balance of {$6100.00} updated as of XX/XX/XXXX. However, there is a clear inconsistency in the payment history section : 1. The payment history shows multiple charge-offs ( CO ) reported consecutively for several months in XXXX and XXXX. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), a charge-off can only be reported once and should not appear as a recurring event. Reporting a charge-off for multiple months is factually incorrect. 
2. Additionally, the payment history indicates a 30-day and 60-day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX after the account was already reported as charged off in previous months. Once an account is charged off, it can not have additional late payments reported. This is a clear violation of accurate reporting standards under the FCRA. 
Requested Actions : 1. Reinvestigate this account information with CBNA to verify its accuracy.

2. Correct the status of the account by removing the repeated charge-off entries and the inaccurate late payments if they are indeed errors, or provide supporting documentation validating the reported information.

3. Update my credit reports accordingly and send me corrected copies. 
Please consider this letter as a formal dispute under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I have attached a copy of my credit report highlighting the inaccurate information for your reference and request that XXXX and XXXX also verify the accuracy of this account.

The total value of the purchase was {$1500.00}, with each card worth {$500.00}. The order number is XXXX, and the last three digits of the card numbers are # XXXX, # XXXX, and # XXXX, respectively. 

Initially, I received an email confirming the delivery of the eGift Cards, but I encountered significant difficulty in accessing the card details. Despite multiple attempts and considerable effort, including contacting your customer service by phone multiple times and waiting on hold for extended periods, I eventually managed to resolve the issue on my own. The details appeared to be restricted for security reasons. While I can appreciate the necessity of stringent security measures, the process was unnecessarily cumbersome and frustrating. 

Unfortunately, a far more serious issue emerged after obtaining the card details. When attempting to use these eGift Cards for online shopping, I discovered that many merchants declined them or expressed uncertainty regarding their validity. In several instances, transactions were outright rejected, either due to the merchants ' inability to verify my rightful ownership or for unspecified reasons. 

As a consumer, my primary motivation for purchasing these prepaid eGift Cards was to enjoy the convenience, portability, and security they are supposed to offer. However, these benefits have been completely overshadowed by the cards ' impracticality. Instead of a hassle-free payment method, these eGift Cards have become an undue burden, requiring me to expend time and effort to identify merchants who might accept them.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,FL,339XX,,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11627770

Nature of the Complaint : Inaccurate Reporting : The late payments reported for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on my credit file are inaccurate. I have consistently made my payments on time and have been enrolled in autopay for this account. 
Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA.

Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : The reporting practices may violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information. 
Account Details : Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX High Balance : {$31000.00} Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Balance Owed : {$0.00} Account Status : Closed Payment Frequency : Monthly Reported Late Payments : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX Requested Resolution : I request that Experian conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payments from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments. 
I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of these entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer.

In several instances in my dealings with them, they did not perform and violated several consumer laws. I had XXXX credit card accounts with them and I contacted them with billing concerns and formally lodged a billing dispute complaint. I sent the first letter to them on XX/XX/XXXX and then again on XX/XX/XXXX. They did not respond to either of the disputes within 30 days as the law states and made no attempts to investigate the matter. My complaints were about 15 USC 1666b and 1666d. They did not abide by these laws in how my account was handled and how they reported my activity. 

After several conversations with the various departments they sitll didnt even acknowledge the fact that I had in good faith submitted billing disputes on both of my accounts. Ultimately they wound up closing both of my accounts citing a violation of the cardholder agreement. They told me that they do not accept the form of payment I sent in. I sent them a registered security to satisfy payment and a security is a lawfull form of payment. When calling them and asking me to send them in writing that they do not accept securities ( commercial paper bonds ) as payment, they hung up on me several times. Finally, after calling back several times, they blatantly told me that they could not send me that information in writing. It was enough of a reason for them to close my accounts but they absolutely would not send me it in writing. My last communication with them was on XXXX, XXXX 2024 at around noon CST, on several recorded lines and this is where they told me they couldn't send me this information in writing. 

The reason why they would not send me the information in writing is because it backs up my stance in the disputes with them and also because they are committing securities fraud and evading paying taxes on the proceeds from those securities. They take their receivables, securitize them in a trust, and then trade them on the primary and secondary markets where they do not have to be registered for a few different reasons. First, they are a foreign limited liability company that doesn't have to register securities and secondly, they get securitized as commercial paper which also does not have to be registered, if they are not registered you can surely believe they are not paying taxes on them. This is the reason they refuse to send me the information I requested in writing. In their purchase, pooling and servicing, security and indenture agreement, it states that they do not and will not engage in any fraudulent practices when it comes to their investors and their handling of securities and then they evade obligation or liability by refusing to provide documentation when requested to an investor who feels that they are being used to commit the fraud.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,IA,528XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-04-09,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8736360

2017-01-24,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"I have been consistently misled and kept in the dark about the process of my repayment and deferment. I called XXXX on around XXXX XXXX XXXX, and was told that I would be out of deferment and able to begin repaying my loans, waving my rights for the grace period. Because of usurious interest rates of XXXX and other student lenders, I accepted. The period in which I was to wait to enter repayment lapsed, and I was not notified and remained unable to begin repayment, which I needed to refinance my loans. I called XXXX to be told I was not going to be taken out of deferment, but instead would need to send a letter to request to forego the grace period and deferment in order to begin repayment. In the meantime, I accrued interest at usurious rates. 

The same story happened at Discover. I called on XXXX XXXX XXXX, and was told I needed to send a letter to Discover Student Lending services to remain out of deferment because "" the system fluctuates and takes people out of deferment. '' No changes on my account occurred, and I called back roughly 10 days later ( accruing well over {$100.00} in interest over that period, over {$100.00} in seven days, to be specific ). When I called to inquire about this, I was told they were waiting to take me out ( two business days after the 5 business day period I was told ) of deferment. I was told in that phone call contradictory information, i.e., that I did not need to send a letter. I called on the following Monday, and was told I did need to send a letter, and that I had n't been given false information. I was under the impression that this would be a personal letter, as the first representative stated. The representative did n't state otherwise and offered no specifics. I later called back to get specifics, only to be told to "" hold '' while the representative "" researched '' the policy. She returned to the phone to tell me that I needed a letter from my university requesting to forego my grace period and deferment and enter repayment. This seemed odd, given the substance of the first and second representatives ' information. I requested to speak with a supervisor, who then told me I did need to send a letter -- he later informed me of the upload feature, but only after I mentioned a lawyer. No other representative offered knowledge of an immediate upload feature. US mail would have taken additional time, and additional interest. Anyway, this supervisor told me I needed to send a personal letter -- not a letter from my university -- in order to forego grace period and deferment. I asked, "" This is the fifth person I 've spoken to, and the fifth type and level of asymmetry of information I 've received. '' He said, "" It 's on the website. '' I said, "" Show me. '' He could n't, and after a brief hold, returned to tell me "" it 's not on the website. '' I said, "" Interesting. '' I then asked about the interest I 'd accrued during this week and a half run around. He misrepresented that amount, and said, "" It would be 'dollars. ' '' I said, "" How many 'dollars? ' '' His rejoinder : "" over {$100.00}. '' I accrued over {$100.00} additional dollars in interest in "" seven days, '' while they misled me and fed me false information. They did the same for four years, leading us to believe -- without any notifications -- that we would n't be accruing significant interest, burying the transparent amount over the course of years ( again, without even a courtesy call to let me know the amount I 'd accrued ). I had accrued {$30000.00} in 4 years while working toward a XXXX.

I believe I did have XXXX back them but I didnt owe them any money at all. Until XXXX or XXXX, I had a flip phone. I subscribed to the phone plan with the lowest fee as I do not talk on the phone or text very much. To hear I owe {$150.00} to XXXX, which was bought out by XXXX in XXXX, is absolutely astonishing. There were simply no circumstances under which I would have racked up such a large amount to a phone company. 

What I believe is going on is that during the acquisition in XXXX, XXXX bought XXXX debt. XXXX inflated the debt. It used innocent people like me, fabricating alleged charges they owed. 

Id like to know how, since XXXX, I was able to switch my phone service several times, keeping the same phone number. So far as I know, phone companies do not let you sign up if you still owe money to another phone company. And they certainly do not let you keep your old number. 

I have not contacted True Accord, which is bombarding me with demands practically every day. I dont want them to have my XXXX XXXX address or email address or phone. That is information they require. 

No proof of my owing {$150.00} to XXXX was given to me by XXXX XXXX. 

I made phone calls when I was with XXXX that were within the confines of the monthly plan I signed up for, which was the cheapest plan since I have low phone usage. If True Accord is doing this to me I am elderly, not a teen whos on the phone all day or someone who calls foreign countries regularly they are also doing it to others. I simply refuse to cough up a large amount of money to a greedy corporation and its henchmen who are fabricating stories about my nonexistent overuse of my phone XXXX or more years ago.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,TrueAccord Corp.,TX,78209,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2025-03-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12193222

Both of these companies have initiated intimidation practices to prevent consumers from exercising their rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In response to consumers ' requesting investigation of inaccurate information on credit reports, Transunion and XXXX are blocking consumers ' credit reports and restricting consumers ' access to view their credit reports and/or investigative results. In addition, creating obstacles when consumers ' realize the report is blocked and request that it be unblocked by advising consumers ' they need to print a physical copy of their driver 's license and social security card, go to the post office, spend their own money and mail their sensitive information to the credit agency in order to have access to their own credit reports. Asking these agencies to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and investigate inaccurate information appears to result in illegal, punitive action to scare consumers into not disputing inaccurate information found on Transunion and XXXX credit reports. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) is the primary federal law that regulates credit bureaus and protects consumers credit information. Under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ( XXXX  ), credit bureaus can not lock or freeze your credit report without your consent. This law mandates that : 1.

Credit bureaus can not lock or freeze a credit report without the consumers explicit request. 3. Credit freezes must be lifted upon requestwithin one hour if requested online or by phone. I did not request that Transunion block my credit report and I am demanding my report be unlocked immediately.

I contacted Transunion on XX/XX/XXXX and requested to have my credit report unlocked and Transunion refused to do so, despite the FCRA stating this must be completed with 1 hour of the consumer 's request. In addition, these credit reporting agencies have experienced data breaches, proving they can not safely handle consumer information, therefore they should refrain from requesting that consumers ' make paper copies of driver 's license and social security card and mail it to their office.

Dispute Department RE : Formal Dispute of Inaccurate Credit Reporting under FCRA and Consumer Law To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items. 
Recent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding Experian 's failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against Experian, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA. 
As per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), Experian is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.

I hereby request that Experian : 1. Conduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items [ list the specific accounts or items you are disputing ].

2. Provide me with all documentation used to verify the accuracy of the disputed information.

3. Correct or delete any information that can not be verified or is inaccurate, as mandated by law. 
Given the recent CFPB findings, I expect Experian to handle this dispute with the utmost seriousness and compliance with legal standards. A copy of my identification and any relevant supporting documents are enclosed to facilitate your investigation. 
If Experian fails to comply with its obligations under the FCRA, I will not hesitate to escalate this matter to the CFPB and pursue any necessary legal action to protect my rights. 
Please respond to this dispute in writing within the legally mandated timeframe. I expect written confirmation of any changes made to my credit file.

After disputing a collection account reported by this entity, I discovered that no proper investigation was conducted. Instead, the account was updated to include a past-due balance, inaccurately reflecting the account as open and actively delinquent. 

This reporting practice is inconsistent with FCRA requirements and legal precedents that emphasize the accuracy and completeness of credit reporting. 

Details of the Issue XXXX. Account Information : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts, same number listed on my report, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX : Date of my original dispute : XX/XX/XXXX Date of response/update : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. Violation of FCRA and XXXX XXXX XXXX : FCRA XXXX XXXX ( b ) : This section mandates that furnishers of information ( creditors and collection agencies ) conduct a proper investigation upon receiving a consumer dispute. Updating the account with incorrect information without investigating violates this provision. 
FTC Advisory Opinion ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has noted that collection accounts are not open accounts and, therefore, should not reflect ongoing past due balances. Reporting such balances misrepresents the nature of the account and creates a misleading credit profile. 

Relevant Legal Precedents XXXX. XXXX v. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( S.D. Iowa XXXX ) : This case highlights that reporting inaccurate or misleading information about a consumers credit violates the FCRA and creates actionable harm. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX  XXXX ) : The court ruled that creditors and furnishers must ensure the accuracy of reported information and investigate disputes thoroughly. Failing to do so can result in liability under the FCRA. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) : This case established that credit reporting agencies and furnishers must take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of their information. 

Request for Resolution I respectfully request the following : 1. Immediate removal as it does not align with the nature of a collection account.

Supporting Documents I have attached copies of the following : Response received from the collection agency/credit bureau Copies of my credit report showing the inaccurate reporting.

Impact on Me This inaccurate and misleading reporting has caused unnecessary damage to my credit score, hindering my ability to refinance my mortgage.

I trust the CFPB will take appropriate action to ensure compliance with FCRA regulations and address this issue. I also request that the CFPB investigate the practice of reporting past-due balances on collection accounts, which is inherently misleading and not reflective of their closed status.

I applied for as many scholarships and grants that I could qualify for with the hope of receiving as much financial assistance that I could to utilize towards furthering my education. In XXXX I enrolled in the University XXXX XXXX XXXX where I finished my XXXX XXXX. I did this because while attending that school the tuition was roughly half that of the main campus at the University XXXX XXXX. I did all of these laborious tasks to cut down my costs for higher education. After receiving my XXXX  degree and not being able to afford to repay my student loans, I called your organization to hear my options and ask for assistance. I signed up for the deferment plan versus an income based repayment plan because the representatives stated that deferment would be the best option for me based on my financial situation. I feel as though I was mislead by not being advised to utilize the income based repayment plan, which would have been the best option so that I would not have had to use finite loan deferment time while also accruing more interest on the loans. 

Once I graduated with my XXXX degree, I realized that I couldnt afford to repay my student loans even though I was working two part time jobs. Around XXXX I was finally advised by your representatives to enter an income based repayment plan. In XXXX, I moved to XXXX XXXX, CA and it took me roughly 4 years to gain employment where I could finally afford certain necessities such as health insurance and a 401k account. Less than a year into that position, I am now required to pay student loans that I simply can not afford. The cost of living in XXXX XXXX is almost 50 % higher than the national average and in order to live in accordance with societal expectations, one must budget accordingly. The monthly payment estimator on your website states that in the current program that Im enrolled in, I will owe $ XXXX/month. That is upwards of 20 % of my take home income. The estimator does not take into consideration the cost of living expenses for residing in a more costly city like XXXX XXXX, which makes it more difficult to save towards any future goals, such as buying a home or saving for retirement.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",CA,92116,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3154814

On XX/XX/year>, I contacted Experian to dispute a debt reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which I believe to be inaccurate and fraudulent. This balance resulted from identity theft, and I have taken the necessary steps to report this matter, including filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ).

Additionally, I requested that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX validate the debt, including providing all relevant documentation such as the original contract and supporting records that demonstrate the validity of the debt. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to provide me with any of the documents I requested to validate the debt. 
Despite XXXX failure to provide the necessary validation, Experian has informed me that XXXX "" proved '' the debt to them and has therefore refused to remove the item from my credit report. This decision violates my rights under the FCRA and the protections afforded to victims of identity theft. 
This unresolved issue has caused significant distress and has negatively impacted my credit profile. Experians failure to ensure the accuracy and verifiability of reported information, particularly in the context of identity theft, is unacceptable. 
I am requesting the following actions : A full investigation into the validity of this debt and Experians compliance with FCRA requirements. 
Immediate removal of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account from my credit report due to the lack of proper validation and the identity theft claim. 
Confirmation in writing that the issue has been resolved. 
I trust the CFPB will take my complaint seriously and take appropriate steps to ensure Experian adheres to the requirements set forth in the FCRA, particularly as it pertains to identity theft.

2024-11-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding Experians handling of disputes related to an inaccurate voluntary repossession account on my credit report. Despite multiple disputes, Experian has failed to address the discrepancies I have raised and continues to report incorrect information.

Issue Details : 1.Account Information : Original Creditor/Lender : XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date of Dispute : XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year> XXXX of the Discrepancy : Experian is reporting an inaccurate balance on this account. The reported balance of {$7000.00} does not match the correct balance of {$7100.00}. 
I have provided supporting documentation in my previous disputes to demonstrate the correct balance, yet Experian claims the account has been verified without addressing the discrepancy. 
3.Repeated Disputes Without Resolution : I have disputed this information twice through Experians dispute process. Each time, the response has been that the information is verified and accurate, but no explanation or evidence has been provided to substantiate this. 
The reporting remains inaccurate, which negatively impacts my creditworthiness and financial opportunities. 

Request for Resolution : I request the following actions : 1. That Experian conducts a thorough investigation into this account and provides evidence from the original creditor verifying the balance they claim is correct. 
2. That the inaccurate information is deleted entirely from my credit report promptly, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) if it can not be verified.

3. That I am provided with detailed documentation of how Experian reached its conclusion regarding the dispute.

Supporting Documentation * Copies of my previous dispute submissions to Experian. 
* Any statements, receipts, or correspondence demonstrating the correct balance of the account. 

Impact of the Inaccuracy : This inaccurate reporting has caused significant stress and financial hardship. It has resulted in denial or unreasonable terms for a car loan, limiting my ability to secure reliable transportation. 
I trust that the CFPB will investigate this matter and ensure Experian upholds its obligation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) to maintain accurate and verifiable information. If Experian can not verify the accuracy of this account, I request its deletion from my credit report.

The following issues exist with the reporting of this account : 1. Charge-Off Status : The account has been reported as charged off ; however, I have not received any formal notification, including a Form 1099-C, verifying that the debt has been charged off in compliance with IRS regulations.

JPMorgan Chase Bank can not collect on a discharged debt. This is now considered a certificate of indebtedness per the IRS and income can not be reported. The IRS Clearly defines a charge off as Gross or Ordinary income, INCOME DOES NOT GET REPORTED ON THE CONSUMER REPORT which in fact makes reporting of this account inaccurate! I provided a screenshot from the IRS website. By Definition, the IRS Clearly says a Cancelled debt or Charge off is Income. The reporting of this account as a debt is inaccurate. I never received a 1099-C from JPMorgan Chase Bank for the cancelled debt of { { {$4100.00} } } in order to file as ordinary income. Where is my 1099-C JPMorgan Chase Bank is clearly writing off debt with the IRS without sending out 1099-C as required by the IRS for debts greater than { { {$600.00} } }. This is unsatisfactory!

No further action is required if the consumer 's current location is not known to the creditor and can not be traced through the consumer 's last known address or telephone number.

2025-01-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to dispute the inaccurate and misleading reporting of the closed account referenced below on my credit report. I demand the immediate deletion of this account from my credit report due to numerous violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681 and its subchapters, which require accurate, complete, and up-to-date reporting of all credit information. 

The account in question is listed as a charged off auto loan, but the information is inaccurate, incomplete, and misleading. Below are the key discrepancies and violations : Account Information : Account Number ( redacted ) : XXXX Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Type : Auto Loan Account Status : Closed High Balance : {$23000.00} ( XXXX and Experian ) ; {$15000.00} ( XXXX XXXX Last Verified : XX/XX/XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX Balance Owed : {$15000.00} Closed Date : XX/XX/XXXX Account Rating : Derogatory ( Across All Bureaus ) Payment Status : Collection/Chargeoff Creditor Remarks : Charged off as bad debt / Merchandise taken back by XXXX XXXX Payment XXXX XXXX {$0.00} Last Payment : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX and Experian ), XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) Past XXXX Amount : {$4900.00} ( XXXX ) Discrepancies and Violations : Incorrect Date of Last Activity The "" Date of Last Activity '' is reported inconsistently across the credit bureaus : XXXX reports XX/XX/XXXX XXXX 
Experian reports XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX reports XX/XX/XXXX. 
This inconsistency violates 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which mandates that credit information must be accurate, complete, and up-to-date. 
Failure to Correct Inaccurate Reporting of XXXX The account is listed as "" charged off as bad debt '' across all three credit bureaus, which is misleading and incorrect. The account was disputed previously but was reported with contradictory remarks : Experian and XXXX report that the dispute was resolved and indicate that the account was resolved by the data furnisher, but the charge-off status still remains. 
XXXX reports that merchandise was taken back by the credit grantor, which does not accurately reflect the accounts status and is an incomplete and misleading statement. 
Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), if an account is disputed and later resolved, the credit reporting agencies are required to ensure that the information reported is accurate. This account has not been properly corrected, thus violating the FCRA. 
Inaccurate Payment History The payment history is inconsistent : XXXX and Experian report the last payment as XX/XX/XXXX, whereas XXXX reports the last payment as XX/XX/XXXX. 
This discrepancy in payment history is a direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which requires a credit reporting agency to correct any inaccuracies and ensure the account history is properly reported. 
Inaccurate XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is reporting a past due amount of {$4900.00}, which is incorrect. The past due balance should reflect the current status of the account, including any payments or adjustments made, but the figure is outdated and incorrect. This violates the requirement under 15 U.S.C. 1681c to report accurate and complete information. 

Failure to Properly Report Account Status The account was closed and charged off, but the FCRA Section 1681e ( b ) requires that information on closed accounts be fully accurate. The inaccurate remarks and inconsistent reporting of the status of the account suggest that the account is still open or unresolved, which is not the case. This misreporting is misleading and violates my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681c.

Legal Right to Seek Damages : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681n, I am entitled to seek statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation if the credit reporting agencies willfully fail to comply with the FCRA. The multiple violations outlined above constitute willful noncompliance, and I am prepared to pursue legal action to recover statutory damages for each violation if this matter is not resolved to my satisfaction. 

XXXX Requested : Given the severe and multiple violations outlined above, I demand the following actions : Immediate Deletion of the Account This account must be permanently removed from all of my credit reports due to its inaccurate and misleading information. 
Correction of XXXX XXXX and Account XXXX If this account is not deleted, I demand that all information regarding late payments and the account status be corrected to reflect the true nature of the account, including any payments made. 
Full XXXX and XXXX of Account XXXX I demand an immediate and thorough investigation into this account, ensuring that accurate and complete information is reported to all three credit bureaus. 
Confirmation of XXXX I expect a written confirmation that the creditor has been notified of this dispute and that all inaccurate information has been corrected or removed from my credit file. 
Failure to comply with my request will result in my filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and I will pursue legal action for damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation under 15 U.S.C. 1681n.

Despite my multiple submissions of the required documentation as a victim of human trafficking, Experian continues to deny my request to block adverse information from my credit file.

Specifically, I have provided : A self-attestation letter signed by both myself and an authorized officer from an authorized agency.

A victim determination letter, also signed by myself and the authorized agency.

These documents have been submitted to Experian on three or four separate occasions. While both XXXX and XXXX accepted the same documentation and blocked the adverse information as required under Section 605C, Experian has refused to do so. This has caused significant inconsistencies across my credit reports and continues to harm my financial standing. 

Experian has repeatedly sent me identical, automated responses, despite my compliance with all legal requirements for exercising my rights under the FCRA. It appears there has been no meaningful human review of my case, yet the only denial reason they give is for me to submit a victim determination letter even though I have sent it to them on numerous occasions I respectfully request that the CFPB : 1. Investigate the methods and tools Experian is using to determine its denial of my request to block adverse information.

2. Require Experian to conduct a human review of my case, as their automated responses fail to address the merits of my documentation and circumstances.

3. Ensure Experian complies with its obligations under Section 605C of the FCRA, as both XXXX and XXXX have already done. 

As a victim of trafficking, I should not be subjected to this repeated and unjust denial of my rights, especially after providing all required documentation multiple times. I urge the CFPB to intervene and hold Experian accountable for its obligations under the law.

Below are the details of my complaint : Company Information : Solar Mosaic Timeline of Events : On XX/XX/year>, I contacted Solar Mosaic by phone to inform them of my difficulty in making payments and requesting alternative options for the short term. During this call, the representative suggested that I apply for a hardship modification to which I agreed. The representative suggested that the hardship modification may give me the short term reprieve to allow time to catch up with payments. 

Following this conversation, at XXXX AM on XX/XX/year>, I received an email from XXXX confirming my request for a hardship modification and requesting that I upload evidence of my hardship to include a hardship letter and XXXX months of bank statements. The info was to be uploaded to Mosaic via a secure web link which was provided in their email. 
I acquired the bank statements and hardship letter and compiled and uploaded the requested documents in XX/XX/year>. 
On or about XX/XX/year>, I contacted Solar Mosaic and spoke to a representative who confirmed receipt of my documents and furthermore stated that my request was under review. 

From XXXX through XX/XX/year>, I received multiple calls from representatives of both Solar Mosaic and XXXX XXXX. During these calls, I explained that I had submitted a hardship modification request to Solar Mosaic. 

The representatives from Solar Mosaic informed me that my application was received but still being reviewed, while the XXXX XXXX stated that they were the debt collectors for Solar Mosaic and would proceed to reach out to Solar Mosaic to confirm my hardship request. Both parties assured me that our conversations were being recorded and that they were also updating my account notes to reflect the pending hardship modification request and our contact. 

From XXXX through XX/XX/year>, I also subsequently received written communication from Solar Mosaic & XXXX XXXX regarding the past due amount of my loan, including threats of default and referral to a debt collector. While I proceeded to make some payments to Solar Mosaic during that period, I never received any written update or decision regarding the status of my hardship modification request which was submitted in XX/XX/year>. 

In XX/XX/year>, I received a notice from a credit monitoring service that my solar mosaic loan had been closed and possibly transferred to a debt collection agency, XXXX XXXX XXXX.I contacted Solar Mosaic who confirmed that the company had transferred my account to XXXX XXXX XXXX and they had no further response or update concerning my hardship modification request and referred me to XXXX  XXXX. 

Violations and Concerns : - Failure to Communicate : Solar Mosaic failed to provide a written response or update regarding the outcome of my hardship modification request. 
- Deceptive Business Practices : Promising to review my hardship request while subsequently transferring my account to a debt collector without notice constitutes misleading and deceptive business practices. 
- Lack of Transparency : Solar Mosaic did not provide any documentation or explanation for the transfer of my loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Emotional and Financial Impact : This mishandling has caused financial strain, emotional distress, and negatively impacted my credit score.

Requested Action : Conduct an investigation into Solar Mosaic 's handling of hardship modification requests and their failure to communicate decisions to customers.

Determine whether Solar Mosaic violated any Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) regulations related to deceptive business practices.

Require Solar Mosaic to restore my account to good standing and process my hardship modification request as originally submitted. 

Ensure the removal of any negative credit reporting caused by this transfer to a debt collector. 

Promptly address this matter due to the urgency of the situation, as the debt collector is currently seeking full repayment. 

While I am not seeking financial compensation for emotional distress at this time, I reserve the right to pursue this and every other legally available option if the issue is not resolved swiftly & amicably.

2025-02-03,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"consumer Reporting Agencies play a crucial role in gathering and assessing consumer credit information. However, they must exercise their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumers right to privacy. The banking system relies on accurate and fair credit reporting, and when these reporting methods are unfair, it undermines public trust, which is vital for the system 's stability. I never gave my explicit, written consent for these agencies to report my information, which is a violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ). This violation has led to an alleged case of identity theft, breaching 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. The accounts in question are not related to any transactions made by me.

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was created to ensure that laws and procedures are in place to protect consumers from abusive, deceptive, and unfair practices by debt collectors. In this case, the company has violated 15 U.S. Code 1692f, which prohibits debt collectors from using unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt. Specifically, they can not collect any amounts that arent explicitly authorized by the agreement or allowed by law. Additionally, the company has violated 15 U.S. Code 1692e, which prohibits the use of false, deceptive, or misleading representations in debt collection efforts. This includes using deceptive methods to collect a debt or gather consumer information. Moreover, they are forbidden from contacting consumers at inconvenient times or places, or engaging in behavior that harasses or abuses consumers. 

In this case, the company has harassed me by claiming I owe a debt that I do not recognize as my responsibility. They have also contacted me at inconvenient times and places, in violation of the law.

In short, I never received such a warning notice!

Account # XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/year> Amount : {$1900.00} The information reported on all of these accounts is inaccurate and should not appear on my credit report. I initially filed a dispute with Experian, requesting a proper investigation into these accounts. However, Experian failed to follow up on my dispute and did not take any corrective action to address the inaccuracies. 



I recently learned that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has filed a lawsuit against Experian. The allegations against Experian include : Accepting unreliable and inaccurate information from data furnishers, and Failing to notify consumers of the results of their disputes in violation of federal laws. 



These allegations align directly with my situation. Experian has not made any effort to address my dispute, remove the inaccurate information, or correct the errors despite their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 



The presence of these inaccurate and derogatory accounts on my credit report is negatively affecting my financial stability and opportunities, including my ability to secure housing and a vehicle. Experians failure to address this matter is not only a violation of my rights as a consumer but also a breach of federal laws designed to protect consumers from these exact issues. 



I am requesting the immediate removal or correction of these derogatory marks from my credit report. This matter must be resolved promptly, as these inaccuracies are causing undue hardship. If this issue is not addressed, I will have no choice but to pursue additional legal remedies to protect my rights.

2018-03-15,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Loan balance remaining after the vehicle is repossessed and sold,"Letter I wrote To Wells Fargo Hello, I am writing this letter today to express my frustration and disappointment with Wells Fargo customer service and how I have been unjustly penalized through a bank error. 
A friend of mine, XXXX XXXX, gave me a gift of XXXX XXXX dollars. XXXX sent XXXX XXXX dollars through a wire and another XXXX XXXX dollars through XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX then wanted to revert XXXX XXXX dollars back to her account. XXXX didnt communicate this with me. I would have given XXXX the XXXX XXXX dollars that she wanted back if she did. So, my account was frozen by the fraud department without an email being sent or the courtesy of an explanation prior to the account being frozen. I only saw a number posted on my online Wells Fargo account. The phone representative explained that the account was under investigation for fraud. He explained to me that the funds were unauthorized. XXXX never claimed the transaction was unauthorized. After explaining to the representative that I had nothing to do with this, I was told that the account would be unfrozen and to follow up on Tuesday, the next week. I decided to wait it out and my account was closed on the following Monday. After following up on Tuesday, speaking to around 10 reps in many departments, including supervisors, I was told that the account was closed and that it couldn't be reopened. 
My credit card was then closed because my checking account was closed. The only checking account I had was a Wells Fargo College account. I was satisfied with what I had and never thought to open another checking with a different bank to deposit my money. After my checking account was closed unjustly, all the payments that were due to be sent ended up being charge backs into all my credit cards and my University account. The charge back fees amounted to around XXXX $ and I ended up with late payments. Up until then, I had 260 payments always on time and no derogatory marks in my credit history. I couldnt even get my money back. I had put a lot of effort and work into building my credit. It was XXXX and now its at XXXX. Its unjust that I had to be a victim of a bank error and not be able to find a rep that could help solve the issue. 
I went to two banks in person to be misinformed about reopening my college checking account with the same stipulations I had before. I was told that they could reopen the same closed checking and credit card accounts. All in all, I was left with a bad memory of the poor Wells Fargo customer service, loss of the time and loss of money ( many hours it took to earn the money ). There were no reparations for that and most importantly no accountability of the bank error. XXXX also contacted XXXX and had a letter sent stating that the two transactions were authorized. 

Thank you. 



I didnt have access to funds or could use checking or credit card to pay my auto loan bill. After months Wells Fargo decided to reopen my college checking account which had been grandfathered and my credit card because of a bank error. Though I was left with my first delinquency on my credit report. 

I couldnt pay my auto loan bill which I was high pressured to get car with misleading tactics along with a XXXX $ warranty. 

I spoke with many reps and Vice Presidents office of Wells Fargo Dealer Services to share my story. They were non compliant to fix my only derogatory credit mark. Wells Fargo Dealer services then disable my online account, so I couldnt make payments on car. They told me I had to pay XXXX or the car would be repossessed. The car was for sale for XXXX and I had already made payments of XXXX $ on the car. I didnt have full balance to pay the car so my car was reprocessed at XXXX and I couldnt do anything about it. 

Now I have a serious delinquency on my credit report and I also cant do anything about it. I was told by a rep that I would still be responsible for payments after the car is sold. What kind of injustice is that? 

I dont have a derogatory mark on 300+ payments for all my credit cards and my credit to debt ratio is around half. 

I was curious to what this delinquency had triggered.

He ended up being a scammer who put me through an online interview and chatted with me for a couple weeks. He said that I would meet with my supervisor and undergo training but first I needed to have office equipment shipped ( hardware, software, printer, fax machine, etc.. ). He sent me 2 checks ( 1. {$4900.00} and 2. {$4900.00} ). The first time on XX/XX/XXXX, he asked me to deposit the check into my bank account at Wells Fargo and then withdraw {$4900.00} in cash to deposit to a "" vendor '' account at XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I attempted to deposit the check at the ATM machine but the alert on the screen said that the value of the check was too high to deposit into the ATM machine and I had to go inside the branch to deposit it and so I did. I deposited the check with XXXX XXXX. I attempted to deposit at XXXX and was denied because the "" vendor '' account was blocked. I then went back to Wells Fargo and deposited the cash in-branch, into a "" vendor '' account ( Acct holder 's name : XXXX XXXX, Acct # : XXXX ). I even showed the teller the account information from the XXXXXXXX on my phone. 

The second check was received on XX/XX/XXXXand I went through the same process, only this time the scammer asked me to do the deposit of the check, withdrawal of cash, and then subsequent deposit into a vendor account ( Acct holder 's name : XXXX XXXX, Acct # : XXXX ) all at Wells Fargo. I did this process again with XXXX in-branch at Well Fargo this time, and XXXX XXXX remembered me from the previous correspondence. 

When I received another check from the scammer I knew something was suspicious. I called Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX to let them know that I was suspicious of recent activity on my account and that's when I was informed that both of the checks I deposited bounced. I then immediately filed a police report, a fraud claim with Wells Fargo, reported this to the FTC and the FBI. 

Wells Fargo denied my claim stating that I authorized the deposits. I asked them why the branch tellers did not warn me that the activity was suspicious and they then responded that I did not deposit the checks in branch. They responded that all teams at Wells Fargo corroborate that I deposited the checks at the ATM machine. I told them that the first time I did attempt to deposit the check at the ATM machine but the alert said that the value was too high to deposit at the ATM machine so I went in-branch. They restated that I deposited the checks at the ATM machine. I asked them to check the security camera footage and the manager said he would request them and then get back to me the next day. He did not get back to me and when I went back to the branch XXXX XXXX ( the personal banker of the case ) said that XXXX ( the branch manager ) was gone for 7 days. The next time I spoke to XXXX XXXX he stated that the resolution team has the footage and it is internal information only.

2025-01-02,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,""" The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent.

I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report. Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role and have a responsibility to report consumer information to the best of their ability with maximum possible accuracy like the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly states.

Additionally, I must emphasize that your agency is obligated to block not only the disputed information or items requested but also any wrong information or items you are reporting on my consumer credit report. Failure to ensure the accuracy of the report violates your statutory responsibilities under FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) and demonstrates a troubling pattern of negligence.

As a result of your continued disregard for these obligations, I have retained a law firm specializing in Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) violations to address this matter. My law firm is actively reviewing your agency 's actions and will pursue all available remedies, including : Filing a lawsuit to seek damages for willful noncompliance under 15 U.S.C. 1681n, including statutory damages, punitive damages, and compensation for financial and emotional harm.

Stemming from the statutes governed by the Rules of Laws, I trust that you will reconsider your obligations under the FCRA and take immediate corrective action to avoid further escalation.

I submitted my initial dispute on [ date of dispute ], along with a Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report and additional documentation supporting my claim. However, your agency has failed to meet its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Violations of the FCRA 1.Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ) Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to conduct a reasonable investigation upon receiving a dispute. Despite providing a comprehensive FTC Identity Theft Report and detailed supporting evidence, I have not received confirmation of any substantive investigation into the disputed items. 
2.Failure to Notify Me of Investigation Results ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ) The FCRA mandates that consumers be notified of the results of an investigation within 30 days of submitting a dispute. To date, I have not received any such notification, nor have I been informed of the outcome of your review or the process by which my dispute was evaluated. 
3.Failure to Block Inaccurate Information Promptly ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) The FCRA requires credit reporting agencies to block information resulting from identity theft upon receipt of appropriate documentation, such as an FTC Identity Theft Report. This has not occurred in my case.

Precedent Cases Supporting My Position Your failure to comply with FCRA requirements is not only a violation of my rights but also exposes your agency to liability, as demonstrated in precedent cases : Cushman v. TransUnion Corp. ( XXXX ) : This case emphasized that credit reporting agencies have a duty to conduct reasonable investigations beyond relying on the data provided by furnishers. 
Ramirez v. TransUnion LLC ( XXXX ) : The Supreme Court upheld consumer rights in disputes related to credit reporting inaccuracies, reinforcing the accountability of credit bureaus under the FCRA. 

Requested Resolution To resolve this matter, I demand the following actions : 1.Conduct a reasonable and thorough reinvestigation of the disputed accounts and transactions associated with my identity theft.

2.Provide a detailed written summary of your investigation, including the steps taken and evidence reviewed.

3.Immediately block or remove all inaccurate information resulting from the identity theft. 

If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaint by filing with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and potentially pursuing legal remedies.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of TILA US Code 1666B since I was never late.

I recently reviewed my consumer report and noticed an incorrect late payment record on my XXXXXXXX XXXX  account [ XXXX ]. I have always maintained timely payments on this account. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), creditors are required to accurately report consumer transactions and provide a mechanism for correcting errors in a timely manner. Please conduct an investigation into this matter, and if you can not provide documentary evidence of these supposed late payments, I demand these payments to be updated to on time as they should be as I was NEVER late. I expect these updates to be made promptly, in compliance with the law.

I sent letters to XXXX, XXXX, and Experian detailing the information I believed was incorrect and requested that they correct the errors and provide me with an update once the changes were made. In compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates a 30-day response period under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), I allowed 30 days, plus an additional 15 days for mailing, for their investigation and response. 

However, I did not see any updates on my credit report. Later, I received a letter from XXXX requesting that I confirm my identity by sending personal documents, which I promptly provided. From the other bureaus, I received no response at all, a clear violation of their obligation to investigate disputes and respond under the FCRA. 

I sent a follow-up letter to all three bureaus, informing them that since they had not responded, they were required under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) to delete the inaccurate information. Additionally, I requested that if they had verified the disputed items, they provide me with the documentation they used to validate the information. Once again, I received no response, which constitutes another breach of the FCRA 's requirements.

This process has been extremely stressful, as the inaccurate reporting has negatively impacted my ability to build business credit. The failure of the credit bureaus to act on my dispute within the legally mandated time frame has now exceeded 60 days since my initial request. In my final letter, sent in XXXX, I stated that I would escalate the matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) if I did not receive a response. Despite this warning, I have still received no communication or resolution. 

The credit bureaus ' noncompliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i has left me no choice but to take matters into my own hands.

2025-03-06,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Complainant : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX Financial Institution : Citi Cards XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, KY XXXX Subject : Formal Billing Dispute Interest Calculation Transparency & Account Protection Account Number : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Disputed Amount : {$7300.00} Complaint Details : I am filing this complaint against Citi Cards regarding a billing dispute for the total amount of {$7300.00} on my credit card account ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a formal dispute to Citi Cards at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, KY XXXX in accordance with my billing rights under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ).

The dispute was submitted because the interest calculations on my account appear inconsistent with the disclosed Annual Percentage Rate ( APR ), Daily Periodic Rate ( DPR ), and Average Daily Balance ( ADB ). The figures provided on my statement do not align with my own calculations, and I have not been provided a clear breakdown of how the interest rate was applied to my account. 

Nature of the Dispute : 1. Incorrect or Unclear Interest Rate Calculations The APR provided does not align with my calculated DPR and ADB, raising questions about how the final interest charge was determined.

2. Lack of Transparency While APR is disclosed, Citi has not provided the raw interest rate used to calculate my charges, making it impossible to verify whether I am being overcharged. 
3. Failure to Provide Required Documentation Under TILA and FCBA, I am entitled to a detailed, written breakdown of how my balance was calculated, including how interest, fees, and payments are allocated. 
4. Potential IRS Compliance Issue Under IRS regulations, any interest amount exceeding {$10.00} requires a 1099-INT form for tax reporting purposes. To date, I have not received one. If Citi Cards has failed to issue the required documentation, this raises serious tax compliance concerns. 

The Core Issue with Interest Calculations The interest rate is the raw percentage charged on the amount I owe before any extra fees or calculations. The APR includes fees and represents the yearly cost of borrowing, while the Daily Periodic Rate ( DPR ) is just a small piece of the APR. But none of these numbers actually tell me the pure interest rate being used to calculate my charges, and thats a major issue. 

APR is a long-term cost representation, DPR is just a step in the math, and the actual interest rate is the hidden percentage that controls how much Im truly being charged. Without knowing the true interest rate, there is no way to verify whether the lenders interest calculations are correct. 

Requested Information : To resolve this matter, I request that Citi Cards provide a full written response detailing the following : 1. A clear separation of the actual interest rate applied versus any fees included in the APR.

2. The precise Daily Periodic Rate ( DPR ) used and how it was derived.

3. A full breakdown of how my Average Daily Balance ( ADB ) was calculated.

4. A detailed explanation of how my APR and daily interest are calculated, including how my payments are allocated between principal and interest.

5. A full review of my account to verify that all calculations have been applied correctly.

6. A revised statement, if necessary, that accurately reflects the interest and payment structure.

7. Clarification regarding any discrepancies that may have led to miscalculations or inconsistencies.

8. Written confirmation that no payments are required until this dispute is fully reviewed and resolved.

9. Issuance of a 1099-INT form for any interest assessed to my account, as required by law.

Legal Protections & Account Safeguards : The Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) both provide protections that ensure consumers can dispute any questionable charge, including interest assessments and balance discrepancies, without the risk of retaliation or unfair treatment by the lender. These laws safeguard my right to request full transparency in how my balance is calculated and ensure that no payments are required until the dispute is properly reviewed and resolved.

As required by law under 15 U.S. Code 1666 ( c ) : My account must not be subjected to adverse action ( such as late fees, penalties, or negative credit reporting ) while this dispute is under review.

The disputed amount can not be collected until Citi provides written evidence supporting the accuracy of the charges.

Additionally, nowhere in federal law does it state that a certain transaction can only be disputed under the Billing Rights Act. My right to dispute interest calculations, balance discrepancies, and account accuracy is protected under multiple consumer protection laws, including TILA and FCBA.

In accordance with federal consumer protection laws, my account should be placed on hold until this matter is fully reviewed and resolved. It is my right to receive a clear and accurate breakdown of how interest and balances are calculated before being required to make further payments. Continuing to impose payment obligations without providing this critical information could be considered unfair and improper under applicable laws.

I also request written confirmation that Citi will not close my account or take adverse action due to this dispute. The law does not limit disputes to specific transactionsconsumers are allowed to dispute total balances, interest calculations, and account inaccuracies without facing retaliation.

Supporting Documentation : Copy of my original dispute letter sent to Requested CFPB Action : I request that the CFPB intervene to ensure that Citi Cards : Provides a full and transparent explanation of how my interest was calculated.

Does not take adverse action against my account while the dispute is under review.

Issues a formal response within 30 days as required by law.

Suspends collection efforts on the disputed amount until the matter is resolved.

Corrects any errors found in the interest calculation and adjusts the balance accordingly.

Issues a 1099-INT form for any interest assessed, as required by IRS regulations .

Since my dispute was filed in compliance with federal law, I am requesting CFPB oversight to ensure that Citi follows all legal requirements and provides the transparency I am entitled to under TILA and FCBA.

2. Experian 's Response : Despite my repeated submissions regarding these inaccuracies, Experian has consistently responded within 24 hours asserting that the accounts are accurate. However, they have not provided me with any evidence or details regarding the nature of their investigation, which I believe is insufficient and violates the requirements outlined in the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ). 

3. Legal Basis for Complaint : - The FCRA mandates that consumer reporting agencies conduct a reasonable investigation into disputes. Experians failure to do so not only undermines my rights as a consumer but also suggests noncompliance with the law.

- Furthermore, Experians actions may violate the CFPA ( 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) - ( B ) ), as highlighted in the CFPB 's recent administrative proceedings that emphasize the obligations of credit reporting agencies to ensure accuracy and transparency in their reporting practices.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent.

An estimate of my monthly payment if I were to refinance my loans. 
A follow-up call to discuss the estimated payment and compare it to my current payment options before proceeding with any refinance. 

Despite these explicit instructions, a refinance of my loans occurred without my authorization. This action resulted in a higher monthly payment than I was previously paying via a letter when I logged into my account and was notated in my next invoice. 

I contacted AES company around XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX via phone to address this issue. During this call, a representative reviewed my account and confirmed that the initial call notes indicated my request for an estimate and a follow-up call.

I submitted my complaint in writing to American Education Services a few days later after speaking with the AES representative, expressing my displeasure with their actions of refinancing my loan payment without my consent. 

I asked for AES to immediately investigate this matter and take the following corrective actions : Reverse the loan refinance : I request that you rescind the refinance and return my loans to their original status. 
Remove the hard credit inquiry : I request that you remove the hard credit inquiry associated with the unauthorized consolidation from my credit report. 
Waive any fees associated with this error. 
Provide written confirmation of the resolution of this issue, including the reversal of the refinance and the removal of the hard credit inquiry.

I am currently in the process of securing a loan, and the lender requires the security freeze on my Experian account to be lifted. Despite my repeated efforts over the past month, I have been unable to achieve this due to significant issues with Experian 's customer service and system. 

Here are the challenges I have encountered : Phone XXXX XXXX : The various phone numbers listed on XXXX website all lead to the same automated system. After entering my Social Security number and selecting the reason for my call, I am directed back to the Experian website for resolution. 

Website XXXX : When I log into the Experian website, it instructs me to contact support via phone, creating an endless cycle with no resolution. 

Form Submission Issue : After multiple attempts, I was directed to a page offering a form to upload my request. However, upon accessing the provided upload link, it states that freeze requests can not be processed through that link and redirects me back to the website. 

This process is not only inefficient but also severely impacting my ability to proceed with important financial decisions. I have had no such difficulties with XXXX or XXXX, which further highlights the inadequacy of Experian 's systems. 

I urge Experian to address this matter promptly. Please provide clear, actionable instructions for removing the security freeze or connect me directly with a representative who can resolve this issue.

Early this year I began receiving notices against each of my accounts from Chase Bank, other than the home mortgage, that Chase has decided to close all of my personal and XXXX Credit Card accounts. I was given a certain date to close my accounts out. Chase said it was within its rights to do so and they did n't have to give me a reason for their action. Including in those accounts were XXXX custodial accounts ; XXXX accounts belong to my daughters attending XXXX XXXX and XXXX of my XXXX-years old mother. I found it outrageous but decided to comply with their requests. 

I rushed to open new bank accounts with another institution and got new credit cards from XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I went to the local branch of Chase Bank and settled all of my credit cards and withdrew my personal funds.

Later, I learned that bank assessed additional {$87.00} interest on XXXX XXXX, 2015 that also was paid on XXXX XXXX, 2015, via a phone call. I was entitled to a refund on the annual fee of {$85.00} assessed earlier. 

I had used online access, portal provided by the Chase Bank, to manage my accounts. After the accounts were settled and closed Chase took away my on-line access. In XXXX 2015, I was denied a refinancing loan on my personal residence because Chase had reported {$370.00} due on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account and reported XXXX late payments ranging between {$25.00} and {$42.00} over the next three month. That was the first time I learned I had derogatory reports on my credit report. 

I called the Bank on XXXX XXXX to confirm these charges. I did not realize that after I had paid up my last balance and brought my XXXX XXXX balance to XXXX on XXXX XXXX, Chase allowed XXXX unauthorized charges that I had no knowledge of on the XXXX Card on XXXX XXXX and XXXX for {$290.00}. Chase also refunded {$85.00} annual fee and had an outstanding balance of {$200.00}. ( XXXX & XXXX bank statements are attached. ) Over the next 6 months that balance became {$370.00} after Chase added late fee and interest and reported XXXX late payments to the Credit Bureaus. Chase never attempted to contact me via a phone call or sent a customary letter or provided monthly bank statements. 

Chase customer service representative, who identified herself as XXXX, told me that it was not Bank 's responsibility to inform me about my statements because I was using an on-line access. The fact that the on-line access was taken away after I was forced to close my accounts was none of their concern. However, the Bank felt obliged to continue to assess interest and penalties and also reported to the Credit Bureaus but saw no reason to inform me. I requested the bank statements. 

After the bank statements were received I called bank on XXXX XXXX, 2015, to resolve my credit report issues. XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX location told me that I had no recourse and all he could do was to accept my payment of {$370.00} ( includes {$170.00} in penalties and interest ) on the phone that could be charged to my new XXXX XXXX account.

The accounts in question has been reported as a charge-offs, and yet they continue to be furnished on my credit report as an outstanding debt. Furthermore, I stand firm on my position that this reporting is both inaccurate and unlawful, and I demand its immediate removal from my credit report. 
According to the information available to me, the creditor has issued a Form XXXX for this account, signifying that the debt has been canceled and reported as ordinary income for tax purposes. If a charge-off is considered ordinary income, as evidenced by the issuance of a XXXX, it can not simultaneously be reported as a collectible debt. Reporting the account in this manner is not only misleading but also inconsistent with the legal implications of debt cancellation. 
Additionally, the creditor has failed to provide me with a copy of the XXXX form to file on my tax return as required by law. This failure to notify me is another indication of the creditors negligence and failure to comply with regulatory standards. 
Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) requires that information furnished to consumer reporting agencies must be accurate and permissible under the law. The continued reporting of a canceled debt as an outstanding obligation violates these provisions and is causing ongoing harm to my creditworthiness and financial well-being.

I request that the creditor and all associated parties immediately take the following actions : 1. Cease reporting this account as an outstanding debt on my credit report and remove all associated negative marks.

I demand the late payment reported in to be removed.

They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

This lack of action violates both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : Late payments are incorrectly reported for the following periods : Equifax : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
The discrepancies include inconsistent dates of activity, reporting, and late payment histories. 
The account has been verified multiple times, yet the inaccuracies persist without correction.

FCRA Violations : Under 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting on my account suggests a failure to comply with this requirement. Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files. In my case, this responsibility has not been upheld.

Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report.

Written confirmation of the corrections made.

If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other relevant agencies. Please address this matter with the urgency it requires and ensure compliance with federal laws to protect consumer rights.

This action was conducted without proper notification or sufficient evidence, which directly contravenes the protections afforded to me as a consumer under FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ). 
The account in question, XXXX, Account number : XXXX was previously investigated and removed from my credit report. However, TransUnion has reinserted this account without providing me with : 1. Written notification within five business days of the reinsertion, as required by law.

2. Substantial and verifiable proof to justify the reinsertion of the account. 
According to FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ), any account previously deleted may only be reinserted if the furnisher of the information provides verified certification that the account is accurate. Furthermore, the credit bureau must notify the consumer of the reinsertion in writing, specifying the details of the certification. To date, I have not received any such notification or evidence. 
This reinsertion is not only unlawful but has caused significant damage to my credit profile and financial well-being. I am requesting the following actions to resolve this matter : 1. Immediate removal of the reinserted account from my credit report.

2. A thorough investigation into TransUnion 's failure to comply with FCRA guidelines.

3. Written confirmation of the steps taken to address and correct this issue. 
As a consumer, I am entitled to accurate reporting and compliance with all applicable laws. TransUnions actions constitute a breach of my rights, and I trust the CFPB will take appropriate measures to ensure accountability.

XXXX Two-Year Payment History : Late payment reported for XXXX Experian Two-Year Payment History : Late payment reported for XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX Two-Year Payment History : Late payment reported for XX/XX/XXXX.

2. Documentation of Process : Provide a detailed description of the reasonable procedures you have adopted to investigate this dispute, as required by 15 USC 1681i ( 7 ).

3. Correction of Errors : If the late payment reporting can not be substantiated with verifiable proof, promptly update the account to reflect its accurate status as "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late. '' 4. Proof of Late Payments : Provide documented proof supporting the claim of late payments, including specific details such as dates, amounts, and any relevant communication indicating these payments were late. 
Legal References : Per 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ), my consumer report should only contain accurate information regarding transactions between me and the creditor. 

Section 1666 ( b ) of Title 15 mandates that periodic statements must be sent to consumers at least 21 days before the payment due date, ensuring sufficient notice for timely payments. 
Next Steps : If your investigation confirms that the reported late payments are incorrect, I request the prompt correction of my credit report to accurately reflect my payment history. If you can not verify the accuracy of the late payments, I expect you to provide the required details and take corrective actions within the 30-day timeframe mandated by the FCRA.

Despite submitting XXXX previous requests for correction on XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, the information remains incorrect, constituting a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 
Evidence of Error : In reviewing the two-year payment history provided by TransUnion, a 30-day late payment is inaccurately noted for XX/XX/year>. However : Payment records confirm that the payment was made within the grace period. 
No delinquency notices were issued for this period.

The reported 30-day late payment violates 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which requires credit reporting agencies to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer files.

As stipulated by 15 U.S.C. 1666b, creditors must provide periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The failure to correct this error suggests non-compliance with these legal requirements.

Legal Violations : FCRA : 15 U.S.C. 1681i mandates that credit bureaus investigate disputes thoroughly and correct inaccuracies. The persistence of this error demonstrates a failure to fulfill this obligation.

TILA : The inaccurate reporting undermines the Truth in Lending Acts aim to ensure fair and accurate disclosures to consumers.

PAANL : The Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act further reinforces the necessity of providing accurate and timely statements to avoid penalties to consumers, which was not adhered to in this case. 
Desired Resolution : I am requesting the following corrective actions : Immediate removal of the inaccurate 30-day late payment notation for XX/XX/year>. 
Written confirmation of the correction from TransUnion.

Verification of the updated report to ensure the information reflects my actual payment history accurately.

If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint to include filing additional complaints with the CFPB and other relevant agencies, and I may explore legal remedies to address the harm caused by this error.

When I looked at my XXXX credit report it states incorrectly that I have only made one payment, since XXXX, which is not correct and the car would have been repossessed.

Summary of Issues Failure to Remove Debt Balance After Sale : After my vehicle was repossessed and sold, the balance of the debt was not adjusted or removed as required. Despite the sale, the remaining balance has continued to be inaccurately reported.

Resale of Debt and Duplicate Reporting : The original debt was subsequently sold to another lender, and both the original and new debts are being reported on my credit file as active, resulting in a duplicate entry that significantly impacts my credit score. 

Lack of Proper Notice and Validation : I have not received proper notice, validation, or documentation of the debt 's accuracy from either the original creditor or the subsequent debt buyer. 

Violations of Consumer Protection Laws 15 U.S. Code 1681b : Credit reports must be accurate, and lenders must have a permissible purpose to report debts. The duplicate reporting of this debt and its inaccuracies violate this requirement.

15 U.S. Code 1681n : The continued reporting of incorrect debt balances and duplicates suggests willful noncompliance with the FCRA.

15 U.S. Code 1681o : At the very least, the handling of this debt reflects negligent noncompliance, causing significant harm to my credit standing.

Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) 9-610 and 9-611 : The sale of repossessed property requires creditors to provide notice of sale and ensure commercial reasonableness. If proper notice was not given, this could constitute another violation.

This account has been repeatedly disputed without adequate verification, in clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Despite multiple requests for investigation and correction, the credit bureau has failed to comply with the thorough and reasonable verification requirements under the FCRA, relying solely on automated and inconsistent responses. 
Inconsistency Reporting : I have identified inconsistencies in the information for this account across all three major credit bureau reports. The discrepancies suggest that the reported information is inaccurate and does not meet the FCRA 's accuracy standards, warranting immediate corrective action. 
Legal Basis and Violations of the FCRA 1. Inaccuracy and Lack of Verification : According to the FCRA, credit bureaus must maintain accurate and verifiable information in credit reports. In this case, the credit bureau has shown a lack of diligence in verifying this account, relying solely on automated systems like e-OSCAR to respond to my dispute. This type of system does not meet the reasonable verification standard required by law, especially in a recurring dispute that significantly impacts my credit history and score. 
XXXX. Inconsistencies Across Credit Bureaus : Upon reviewing my reports from the three major credit bureaus, I have found inconsistencies in how this account is reported. These discrepancies indicate systemic errors in the handling and verification of information by Experian, which further underscores the lack of accuracy and FCRA compliance. 

References to Relevant Case Law To support my complaint, I cite the following legal precedents that reinforce the obligation of credit bureaus to conduct thorough and reasonable investigations : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) : This ruling establishes that credit bureaus must conduct reasonable investigations and can not rely solely on automated responses when a consumer disputes the accuracy of reported information.

However if you say to the machine that you are a new customer wanting to invest money, ha, well after about a 30 minute hold time your put through to a young man who speaks broken English only knows how to say "" NO ''. 

He said my money was locked away and I could not withdrawn Any funds until 180 days later because he said the money was, "" Stake funding ''. 

However, if their are any losses from the. investments of your funds you lose your money, as the money seems to deplete slowly at times and jumps back and forth- up & down. 

This company named CRYPTO.COM makes money regardless of the patrons losses or gain. So say at the end of the 180 days your {$5000.00} investment is down to say {$1500.00}. They promise to pay you 10 % of that balance for using your money!. And the young man said their was no way I could invest my own money or get my original investment of {$5000.00} back just days after I tried using their complicated format which leads the patron into unwittingly allowing CRYTO.COM full control of your money to invest or spend your money on reckless investments, which can lead to the loss of your entire funds. I feel like this is a new start up company and do not yet have the platform to invest anyone 's money. 
I really believe this company should be sanctioned from doing business in the United States as Older investors or military personnel could invest in this company that imitates an established investment brokerage company. 

Then when they are deployed and need their funds they would not have the ability to withdraw their funds. The funds would either tied up for 180 days or gone because of risky uneducated investing by novice unregistered brokers. Why? Because their bitcoin crypto platform is either not properly maintained or this company is seeking older novice investors or military personnel to use and scam the profitable high interest rates paid by high dollar XXXX 's!!!!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Foris DAX, Inc.",TX,78634,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,2021-09-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4323969

I purchased extra benefits such as tire and rim coverage, special internal and external protection. I purchased home electric charger. Included with the lease was a contract with electrifying America to ensure I didn't have to no longer pay for fuel or for anything additional other than regular maintenance. 
Their was several recalls, but none of the dealerships have loaners nor do they have the parts or the techs to service these vehicles. Any time the car has to go in to service or for any issues it takes extremely long to get your vehicle returned. 
I got an electrical malfunction default code and the vehicle stated to contact dealer. I had the vehicle towed on XX/XX/2023. I had to call every week serval times a week to get updated, which most of the time was no information.

2025-01-08,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a formal complaint against MidFirst Bank, which has subjected me to a series of deeply troubling and unethical practices that have caused significant financial and emotional harm. I am currently battling XXXX XXXX, which has made an already difficult situation even more unbearable. The following is a summary of my experience : Unjust Closure of My Claim : After I filed a legitimate claim, MidFirst Bank closed it within one business day without providing any explanation or documentation. This lack of transparency and accountability left me deeply frustrated. To my dismay, the bank later reopened the claim without my consent or involvement, further exacerbating the situation. 

Denial of Communication and Gaslighting : When I contacted customer service to seek clarification, I was met with outright denial. The representatives insisted that my claim had never been closed, which left me feeling completely gaslighted, as though my experience and concerns were of no importance to them. 

Disrespectful and Inhumane Treatment : During one phone call with a representative, who was aware the call was being recorded, I was subjected to laughter and mockery when I explained the distress I was facing, including my financial struggles and the very real threat of homelessness and frostbite. I had hoped for empathy from a professional institution, but instead, I was met with ridicule and a complete lack of compassion. 

Unnotified Account Closure : My account was closed suddenly, without any prior notice or communication from the bank. This left me unable to access the funds I desperately needed, including money to pay my rent. When I attempted to deposit cash directly into my account, I was refused, which resulted in additional fees and left me overdrawn with no means of resolving the situation. 

Discriminatory Treatment : The banks staff treated me with hostility and disdain, behavior which I believe to be discriminatory and unprofessional. This treatment has left me feeling not only financially destitute but also emotionally shattered, as if my dignity and well-being no longer matter to the institution. 

XXXX XXXX : In addition to the above, I am battling XXXX XXXX, a condition that has made dealing with this situation even more distressing. The emotional toll of this experience, combined with the physical toll of my XXXX, has left me feeling isolated and powerless. 

MidFirst Banks actions have not only caused significant financial harm but have also led to an emotional crisis. Their refusal to follow established procedures, coupled with their treatment of me as less than human, has shattered my trust in the banking system. I am seeking your intervention to investigate the matter and hold the bank accountable for its misconduct. 

I'm begging you to help me get my money back, i've attached all the information that they requested, i have recordings of getting trespassed from the bank where XXXX told me that to re open the claim i need to send them all the information needed, which took enorm efforts for me to find as i'm battling an eviction and XXXX XXXX  at the same time, the stress from that experience took a toll on me like i never imagined. 

I also received XXXX XXXX  instead of the XXXX, when i asked them they told me their was a refund, but did not want to provide me from where it came, please help me these people ruined my life.

Background I am disputing fraudulent accounts linked to identity theft that occurred in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX years ago. I have submitted a valid FTC Identity Theft Report. 

However, ChexSystems has : - Labeled my dispute as frivolous and failed to investigate thoroughly. 
- Refused to block fraudulent trade lines despite the clear evidence of identity theft. 
- Requested unreasonable documentation ( a police report from XXXX authorities or a law enforcement-signed FTC Identity Theft Report ), which is not feasible for me to provide. 

Unreasonable Demands for Documentation - ChexSystems ' request for a police report from XXXX XXXX XXXX Police or a law enforcement-signed FTC Identity Theft Report is unreasonable, as the identity theft occurred outside of the XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. It is impractical for a XXXX XXXX XXXX to sign an FTC report or provide a local police report for an international incident.

FCRA XXXX ChexSystems actions continue to violate the FCRA in the following ways : Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation ( FCRA 611 ) : - The company failed to reinvestigate properly, relying only on the information from the reporting institutions.

- Failure to Block Fraudulent Information ( FCRA 605B ) : ChexSystems has not acted on the FTC report and continues to require unnecessary documentation.

Failure to Ensure Accuracy ( FCRA 607 ( b ) ) : - The company has not ensured the accuracy and completeness of my consumer report, despite the evidence provided.

2024-12-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am filing this complaint regarding XXXX key issues involving inaccurate information that Truist Bank reported to the credit bureaus. These errors have significantly impacted my credit score and directly affected my ability to qualify for a Small Business Administration ( SBA ) loan that is essential for my business operations. Despite multiple attempts to resolve this with Truist Bank over the past XXXX months, I have not received any reasonable explanation or corrective action. Below is a detailed summary of the issues, including the actions I have taken and Truist 's responses. 
XXXX. Inaccurate Reporting of an Active Account as "" Closed '' On or around XX/XX/year>, I discovered that XXXX of my active accounts with Truist Bank had been incorrectly reported as "" closed '' to the major credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ). This is factually incorrect because the account is still active, in good standing, and I continue to use it regularly. 
My Actions : I contacted Truist Bank as soon as I discovered this error. 
I provided clear, undeniable proof that the account was active and in use, including : Account statements showing regular activity and ongoing use. 
Screenshots and transaction records confirming the account is open and functional. 
Truist 's Response : Truist responded with a letter stating that "" the disputed account information is accurate as reported '' and that "" there are no changes necessary. '' This response was incorrect and dismissive, as the evidence I provided clearly showed that the account is still active and in use. 
Despite my efforts to escalate the matter, Truist has failed to correct the status of the account, which remains inaccurately reported as "" closed '' on my credit report. 
Impact of This Error : This false reporting has caused a significant drop in my credit score, impacting my ability to obtain financing for my business. 
As a result, I was unable to qualify for an SBA loan that was critical for expanding my business operations. 
This delay has caused serious financial harm to my business and has put me in a position where I am unable to meet my business goals. 
XXXX. Refusal to Remove a Late Payment from a Secured Credit Card The second issue relates to a misunderstanding regarding an expired secured credit card that had a XXXX balance. After the card expired, I was unaware that an annual fee was still owed, as it was not clearly communicated by Truist. This led to a late payment being reported on my credit report. 
My Actions : As soon as I became aware of the balance, I made the payment in full immediately. 
I reached out to Truist Bank to request a "" goodwill adjustment '' for the late payment. I explained that : The card had expired, and I believed I owed nothing, as the balance was XXXX. 
I had a strong history of on-time payments with Truist. 
I made the payment as soon as I realized the mistake. 
Truist 's Response : Truist issued a response stating that "" the information you are disputing was furnished correctly '' and that they would not remove the late payment from my report. 
They did not acknowledge my long history of responsible payments or the goodwill request I made to have the late payment removed. 
I requested clarification of their policy on charging annual fees after a secured credit card expires, but Truist did not provide any explanation or documentation in response. 
Impact of This Error : This late payment was reported to all three major credit bureaus, causing a further drop in my credit score.

This, in combination with the false closed account status, has significantly limited my ability to access financing, particularly an SBA loan essential to my business operations.

The inability to secure this financing has caused serious financial hardship for my business, delaying important projects and creating unnecessary financial strain.

Summary of My Requests Correct the inaccurate "" closed '' status of my active account and report it as "" active '' to all credit bureaus.

2020-06-24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"As a first time home buyer, I was looking for a house in XXXX. I ended up with XXXX XXXX and they routed me to one of their preferred lenders US Bank. I went with them for pre-approval for signing the purchase agreement with the builder in the month of XXXX. I was given initial disclosure on the loan estimate on XX/XX/XXXX though their promised lender credit missing. For every question I asked, there were no clear explanation given on credits not being applied. The interest rate offered for my credit score was 3.875 % In the month of XXXX, they re-opened my loan file. I kept asking them for the new interest rate and the revised loan estimate to do rate shopping. The lender never gave the revised loan estimate and stopped me from rate shopping. They said my credit score would drop and I would not be eligible for the loan program. Inspite of that I went ahead with rate shopping with one of the other preferred lender of the builder XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX with my initial disclosure form US bank. Immediately US bank ordered the appraisal without giving me any room for rate  discussion. I found out XXXX was offering good MI for 3.25 % interest rate. US bank said they can give the same interest rate but never bothered about the MI and also said I will lose my appraisal amount. On XX/XX/XXXX I got the Loan estimate from XXXX and gave it to US bank to check if they can beat the rate and MI. On XX/XX/XXXX, US bank came up with loan estimate with 3.125 % interest rate still with high MI. So I decided to proceed with XXXX and inform the builder the same. XXXX repriced the rate and gave back lot of credits so less Cash to close with a difference of $ XXXXmonth on MI from US bank. In the mean time, US bank kept me in immense stress everyday by not replying emails and answering calls. They said they can not pull the credit report again. If they pull it, then would be able to match XXXX   MI.To keep me with US bank, they promised they will give 2.875 % interest rate so that they can match the XXXX MI as US bank MI couldn't be changed.

This is when US bank started with the plot. They changed the loan program from 97 % conventional to Home possible from XXXX XXXX.I never knew that it has a income limit. Later understood it was a plot to hook me up with a wrong program under lucrative interest rate. I dropped from XXXX and informed the builder I will be going with US bank. US bank again started playing the games on the loan estimate. Without my consent, they charged points to bring down the rates to 2.875 % and the rate was locked. US Bank management didn't agree to give me back the charged amount in the closing costs. Cash to close kept creeping up and they didn't heed to any of the closing costs concerns. 

As the bank was preparing all the documents for the closing date XXXX XXXX, On XX/XX/XXXX there was a sudden inquiry in my credit report. I called equifax to see who made the query. They said it was made by US bank. And it was done with no prior information and without my consent. I asked US bank why don't they fix the MI then, since they have latest report. I kept the file in pending status. I was informed the file will be ready on Monday which is the closing date.

I asked my wife to take off from her work. There was no reply from US bank on Monday other than underwriter is still looking into the file.No response to emails or calls as usual to keep us under immense stress. I asked my wife to take another day off hoping that it will be completed the next day. There was no response and finally Tuesday evening and said I am no longer eligible for the loan program because of the income limit. So they have to give the interest rate as on date with higher MI than before. I was in deep distress since they said rate lock is not valid under the old program. They said they will check with their management. 

They never responded back till Friday. I informed my apartment that I will move out in the weekend. They had a new tenant signed for my rest of the lease, so I didn't have any rent obligation for the rest of the lease. With the delay going on closing the loan, I was forced to change the move out date. The Apartment office called me and said, they lost the tenant with change in dates, so its my obligation to pay the rent for the rest of the months. 

I decided to check with XXXX if they went with right Loan program. They said they have gone with correct loan program and they are still with same interest rate and same MI.I was happy to move with them. Even then US bank instead of giving the promised rate, asked me to cancel XXXX application so that they can close the house with promising any any change in the interest rate/MI/Closing costs.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. 

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent. 

I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report.

On XX/XX/year>, I sent a debt validation letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX disputing an alleged debt ( Account Number XXXX ) and requesting detailed validation as required by law. On XX/XX/year>, I received a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX that failed to adequately address my concerns and provide the requested information. 

My complaints are as follows : Failure to Provide Comprehensive Debt Validation : XXXX XXXX XXXX did not provide the detailed information I requested, including a copy of the original signed agreement, documentation showing the chain of ownership of the debt, and a detailed accounting of the alleged debt. 

Inadequate Response to Credit Reporting Discrepancies : In my initial letter, I raised concerns about discrepancies in reporting across credit bureaus. The company 's response did not address this issue, potentially violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Misleading Information About Legal Obligations : While XXXX XXXX XXXX claims that the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) does not apply to them as the original creditor, they still have obligations under other consumer protection laws, including the FCRA. Their response may be misleading consumers about their rights and the company 's responsibilities. 

Potential Inaccurate Reporting : The company 's response indicates a {$0.00} outstanding balance as of XX/XX/year>. However, this conflicts with the ongoing dispute and the reporting to credit bureaus that prompted my initial inquiry. 

I request that the CFPB investigate these issues and ensure that XXXX XXXX XXXX complies with all applicable consumer protection laws. I seek a full and proper validation of the alleged debt, correction of any inaccurate information reported to credit bureaus, and any other appropriate remedies for the company 's failure to adequately respond to my validation request.

I was unfortunately XXXX  during my birthday celebration, I was found XXXX  on the streets by the local police and was taken to a nearby hospital, upon waking up ( about 8 - 10 hours later ) I opened my eyes to be found in a hospital bed, not knowing how I got there. 

The Hospital did a XXXX XXXX  and determined that I was XXXX, the report from the hospital talks about how and what condition I was found I mentioned this as this is the reason for the complaint against Wells Fargo, during the time I was on the hospital and after with no phone, no money, and access to my accounts, the people who XXXX  me got into my bank accounts ( business XXXX XXXX, XXXX, personal Account, and my Wells Fargo Credit Card, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) and drained my accounts to XXXX in less than 24 hours. I was not able to get back into the states until I was able to get an emergency passport from the US Embassy in XXXX XXXX. 

Upon my arrival in XXXX XXXX, the very first thing I did was to visit my local bank on XX/XX/year>, where I filed multiple complaints for fraudulent activity. 

I showed up at the branch, and while I waited to be seeing, I also was on the phone filing my claims, ( I probably spend over 3 hours at the branch ) Ive explained my situation to the person on the phone ( multiple people ) and to the banker ( XXXX XXXX ). My bank accounts were all drained ( {$16.00}, XXXX from my business account, {$1400.00} from my personal account, $ XXXX from my credit card ), and there numerous transactions back and forth between my credit card, personal account, and business account. 

It was determined that indeed there was fraudulent activity, and the branch requested copies of the reports which were rendered and provided to the branch ( a copy of my police report, hospital report, copy of my emergency passport ) to only find out on the XXXX of this XXXX that the claims department never received the full story and never received any of my reports. 

On this day my bank accounts and credit card were closed, and new accounts ( business and personal ) and credit card were open. This was on XXXX of XXXX, Ive left with the instructions that the bank will open an investigation. Come the XXXX, I could not access my online banking, and was asked to go back to the branch so they can verify me. I was not able to get into the branch until the XXXX of XXXX and unfortunately there was not much to be done as the department that could help me was closed and was asked to come back on Monday. I came back and that was another lengthy visit to the branch as I was somehow flagged in the system as XXXX  and therefore I had no access to my online banking. The banker at the branch spent a lot of time trying to get an answer for me and was not able to get anywhere and the branch manager got involved. It took over 12 people to get my situation figured out, there was a huge lack of incompetence at the customer service level, where we were being bounced back between tech, XXXX, and online department. As a matter of fact, the branch manager was also frustrated with the lack of service from her own company and filed several complaints on my behalf. Nevertheless, my only access was finally granted, and now it was a matter of waiting on the response from their investigation into my numerous claims. 

As the days went by, I had not received any new ATMs for my personal and business, or even a new credit card. I came to find out again someone dropped the ball as those never requested to begin with, again the level of incompetence and attention to detail to my matter and or case. Now, all these are the least of my worries, I was very surprised to see correspondence from the bank saying that they did their investigation and found that the transaction was authorized and therefore did not find any fraudulent activity. I immediately called customer service to inquire as to why they closed the case and came to find out that one they will not re-open and two they had never received the details of information I had given to numerous people over the phone or at the branch level and said they never received the documents, banking up my case. 

I feel that they have not done their due diligence and investigated this matter as if they should or give this the level of importance that they should be. To begin with they could clearly see that the activity that took place on the XXXX has never happened on my account, to completely clear my account to zero and not just my personal also my business. If someone was truly investigating this with the back up documentation and with the type of activity they would clearly see this was fraud and my money should be protected. Never have I done in less than 24 hours ( probably even less than that ) have Ive done one wire transfer, nine XXXX transaction, moving money from my personal to business, from my personal to my credit card, from my business to my personal, looking at ways to just drained my account.

However, they must exercise their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumers right to privacy. The banking system relies on accurate and fair credit reporting, and when these reporting methods are unfair, it undermines public trust, which is vital for the system 's stability. I never gave my explicit, written consent for these agencies to report my information, which is a violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ). This violation has led to an alleged case of identity theft, breaching 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. The accounts in question are not related to any transactions made by me. 

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was created to ensure that laws and procedures are in place to protect consumers from abusive, deceptive, and unfair practices by debt collectors. In this case, the company has violated 15 U.S. Code 1692f, which prohibits debt collectors from using unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt. Specifically, they can not collect any amounts that arent explicitly authorized by the agreement or allowed by law. Additionally, the company has violated 15 U.S. Code 1692e, which prohibits the use of false, deceptive, or misleading representations in debt collection efforts. This includes using deceptive methods to collect a debt or gather consumer information.

Despite my multiple submissions of the required documentation as a victim of human trafficking, Experian continues to deny my request to block adverse information from my credit file.

These documents have been submitted to Experian on three or four separate occasions.

Investigate the methods and tools Experian is using to determine its denial of my request to block adverse information.

2. Require Experian to conduct a human review of my case, as their automated responses fail to address the merits of my documentation and circumstances.

3. Ensure Experian complies with its obligations under Section 605C of the FCRA, as both XXXX and XXXX have already done.

As a victim of this breach, I assert my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and request that you investigate and remove these unauthorized inquiries and inaccuracies immediately.

Upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered several unauthorized inquiries and/or negative marks that I did not initiate, in addition to XXXX accounts that are currently in a collection status should be removed from my credit report. 

I suspect that the inquiries are the results of a data breach which has compromised my personal and financial information, and the inaccurate account statuses for LVNV Funding LLC and XXXX XXXX which are both being reported inaccurate.

Under the FCRA and 15 USC 1681 credit law, I have the right to dispute inaccurate information or fraudulent information on my credit report and request that such information be removed. 

I respectfully request the following : XXXX. Immediate Removal of Unauthorized Inquiries : Please remove any inquiries that were not authorized by me. These inquiries were likely the result of identity theft or a data breach. 
XXXX. Correction of Unfavorable Credit Marks : Any accounts or marks that were negatively impacted by the data breach should be corrected or removed, as they were not caused by any action of mine. 
XXXX. Investigation and Documentation : Please conduct a thorough investigation into the source of the unauthorized inquiries and credit marks and provide me with the written documentation confirming the result of your investigation. 
XXXX. Fraud Alert of Credit Freeze : I also request that a fraud alert or credit freeze be placed on my credit file to prevent any further unauthorized access while this matter is being resolved. In addition to this, I am also requesting a copy of the original signed contract ( s ) or agreement ( s ) that created the alleged debts, a complete and accurate account statement detailing the debt, including any payments made and charges added, and any other supporting documents providing that I owe tha alleged debts.

As you are aware, this breach compromised the personal data of millions of consumers, and I believe that some of my negative accounts may have resulted from fraudulent activity due to this breach. 



In light of the breach and the potential for identity theft, I am requesting that any negative or inaccurate accounts be removed from my credit report. This includes any accounts that were opened fraudulently or affected by identity theft due to the data breach. I would appreciate your immediate attention to investigate this matter thoroughly and ensure the correction of my credit report. 



Please find attached a copy of my credit report, along with documentation of my identity theft or fraud alert, and any other supporting materials to assist in the investigation. I am also requesting confirmation in writing once these negative accounts have been removed or corrected. 



Additionally, I would appreciate information about the steps Equifax is taking to support consumers whose data may have been compromised and the measures that can be taken to prevent further issues. 



Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution of this issue and the restoration of my credit standing.

This XXXX XXXX on Purchases fee is dated/posted XX/XX/XXXX, yet it did not appear on my XXXX bill which last transaction was posted XX/XX/XXXX. They slipped in this unjustified charge without me seeing it. I discovered it over last weekend when I happened to log in online to look at recent charges. Elan is determined to get some interest from me since for the past 2 years 10 months I have had this business Visa through them, I have always paid my balance off each month in full. Never has there been yet even {$1.00} balance left unpaid. 
I called Elan on this wrong interest charge yesterday. XXXX XXXX XXXX said it was for XXXX days late on the XXXX bill payment that was due XXXX XXXX. Let me explain that this was still unjustified. First, let me note the fact, as my previous statements revealed, that they did the same thing to me in XX/XX/XXXX with an unjustified Interest charge of {$70.00}, when my payment was not late. They were hoping that charged wrongfully slipped in that I would not catch. But I did catch it and I called then about that interest charge, and the XXXX waived it and credited back to me. If it was a justified charge, they would not have credited back to me. Now 13 months forward, they did the same thing but this time they did not waive it. Why is it unjustified? CSRs claim was it was based on the payment be late 3 days. But she admitted it was received on Mon. XXXX XXXX. So XXXX XXXX should not be counted as a day. Second, the day before is a Sunday, and XXXX is closed on Sunday. Sunday should not be counted either, for this is penalizing customers for the business being closed on Sunday! Thirdly, the fact is, I mailed this bill by XXXX on Monday XXXX XXXX. And it should have arrived by XXXX. It is clear that XXXX is trying to get some unjustified interest money from me. Lastly, the balance of this XXXX bill due XXXX XXXX was {$1600.00}. It plain wrong to charge {$70.00} of interest for a bill the could have been 2 days late ( but XXXX not even have been late and this could be a sheer corruption charge.

2025-01-01,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem,,"I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, declare and attest under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California, including false statements, perjury, and claims estoppel, that the following statements and events are true, accurate, and correctly stated without any omission or misrepresentation. I make this statement to the best of my knowledge and abilities and do not do so under duress or to unjustly gain any products or services mentioned or itemized in the attached evidence : Unauthorized Charges : I have identified unauthorized charges on my credit card accounts. I have not received any products or services corresponding to these charges. I did not sign up for, approve, or knowingly allow anyone to use my credit cards for these transactions. 

Lost/Stolen Device : One of my two personal telephones was recently lost or stolen while traveling. I have no idea who has it but did notice, according to the device activity, that someone has accessed the device while it was not in my possession. I keep two devices, one for work and one for personal use. While I use a password manager, LastPass, to securely store my passwords, I try to keep my PIN numbers memorized. However, having access to my phone would allow someone to circumvent two-step authentication by receiving text messages. It appears that most of the online charges were made with a debit card, which does not require the PIN. 

Viruses and Malware : Several viruses and malware were discovered and quarantined by the antivirus software on my computer, which was syncing with my phone. 

XXXX Account Breach : My XXXX account was also taken over. The perpetrators attempted to list items and make purchases under my name, directing these activities to my XXXX account, which they also accessed. XXXX noticed these unauthorized activities immediately and locked them out of my account. I do not know the details of what they did on XXXX during the period they had access or how XXXX became aware of the breach, but I am surprised that no banks alerted me or questioned the out-of-pattern transactions that XXXX noticed immediately. 

Mailbox Break-In : My mailbox was broken into and has since been repaired. See the attached photo of the mailbox destruction. I have no idea how or why they managed to do this or why they would target my mailbox. It is strange because a few times there has been a strange person sitting in the hallway outside of my apartment. When I asked him what he was doing there, he said his girlfriend kicked him out. This seems very sketchy to me. The building is a secure building and requires a key for every door and the elevators. You can not access my floor without a key, the same with the mailbox area. I have never seen him before and know many of my neighbors. 

Immediate Actions : Upon discovering the unauthorized charges, I immediately checked all my credit card accounts, made a list of all the unauthorized charges, and began the process of canceling the affected credit cards. Based on recommendations, I have also created new email addresses, reset all passwords, and performed factory resets on all my devices to prevent further unauthorized access. 

Reporting and Legal Compliance : I have reported these unauthorized charges to my credit card companies and relevant authorities as promptly and efficiently as possible given the circumstances. I have acted to the best of my abilities in addressing this issue and have followed the prudent course of actions prescribed by law. 

Legal Rights and Timeliness : Considering that I am within the 60-day period from the date of the statements containing the unauthorized charges, and given the extenuating circumstances in my life, including moving and being involved in a contentious legal matter, I can not be held liable for these charges. According to the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), 15 U.S.C. 1666, and California Civil Code 1747.50, I have reported these unauthorized charges within the legally required timeframe. The case law, such as Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226.12 ( b ), supports that I am not liable for unauthorized use if I notify the issuer within a reasonable time after learning of the loss or theft of the card. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) provide guidelines that protect consumers from being held liable for unauthorized charges if reported within the stipulated time frame. 

Bank Fraud Protection Guarantees : I am aware that several financial institutions, including XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, offer fraud protection guarantees which assure that consumers are not held liable for unauthorized transactions if reported promptly. I have adhered to these policies by reporting the unauthorized charges as soon as they were discovered, thereby invoking the protection guaranteed by these institutions. 

XXXX XXXX  XXXX and cerulean bank both found in my favor. XXXX XXXX XXXX decided to collude with XXXX aka Skrill a payment processor and forged evidence. XXXX submitted the forgery to XXXX XXXX  XXXX who with me identified that it was fraud on XXXX XXXX part. XXXX admitted this and indicated they colluded with XXXX and XXXX. They proceeded to immediately refund the transactions after we caught them. They were dispicable to do this. I will never trust that company again. 

XXXX then tried to make it appears as they were attempting to refund the transactions to my XXXX account ; however, it was not known to me until later that they were colluding with XXXX because when I asked XXXX to refund the money to an account I had control of as the prevailing law dictates they refused. They then stopped talking to me and became very hostile. They attempted three times to refund the transactions, but it was no real because they knew XXXX was going to block them and not permit the refund. 

XXXX after being found out rather than make things right because they had taken such server actions against me decided to double down. They closed the account and declined to allow the refunds to be returned from XXXX. they froze and liquidated assets and caused sever distress and forced me to take over XXXX in losses from the fact that stocks and crypto were down when they forced the sales. that is absolutely horrific and nearly drove me to XXXX I was unable to pay bills or even access any of my money because of what these companies did. As it turns out this was all related to various data breaches and the company knows what they were doing was wrong and they knew that bad actors had been compromising their systems for months.",,"Skrill USA, Inc.",CA,90038,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11345473

Upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that Experian Information Solutions XXXX Inc. accessed and/or sold my personal credit information without my consent or a permissible purpose as outlined under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). This unauthorized action has negatively impacted my financial privacy and may have exposed me to potential risks such as identity theft, unsolicited financial offers, or other unauthorized uses of my personal data.

Unauthorized Sale/Access of My Credit Information Under FCRA Section 604 , consumer reporting agencies are prohibited from selling or sharing credit information without a permissible purpose ( e.g., employment screening, credit applications, insurance underwriting ).

According to FCRA Section 604, consumer reporting agencies and third parties may only access or sell consumer reports for specific permissible purposes, such as : Employment screening Credit applications Insurance underwriting Account review by a current creditor I did not authorize or initiate any transaction that would justify this inquiry or data sale.

15 U.S.C 1681 Section A, section 2, states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish an account without my written instructions. 

XXXX5 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) Section states : No consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following information items : Any other adverse item of information, other than records of convictions and crimes which antedates the report by 7 years.

15 U.S.C 16815-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A person shall not furnish any information creating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Secured Party XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA [ XXXX ] Last XXXX SSN : XXXX | XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX 's Fraud Victim Assistance Department XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX Experian XXXX Department XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TX XXXX XXXX XXXX Department XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX GA XX/XX/XXXX Subject : Final Demand for Fraud Investigation, Validation, Verification, and Cease-and-Desist Regarding Alleged Debt and Inaccurate Reporting To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute and demand immediate resolution regarding fraudulent, inaccurate, and unverifiable information reported under my Social Security Number ( SSN ). This letter also serves as a final demand for validation, verification, and cessation of all related activities under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692g ), Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC 1-308, UCC 1-103 ), and all relevant consumer protection laws.

Furthermore, I emphasize that the alleged debts, accounts, and related reporting provide no valuable consideration or benefit to me, the beneficiary, or my ministry. Therefore, their reporting constitutes improper conduct, unjust enrichment, and misrepresentation of obligations that lack enforceable standing. 
The reporting and collection of unverified and fraudulent debts, misuse of my SSN, and inaccuracies in my credit report require immediate resolution. This correspondence also demands the disclosure of the method of verification and procedures followed, per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ).

Violations and Key Legal Points 1. Violation of Privacy Rights and Fraudulent Credit Reporting Unauthorized access and use of my SSN without explicit consent violates the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) and 18 U.S.C. 1028 ( Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Identification Documents ).

The SSN belongs to the Social Security Administration, and any attempt to collect a debt tied to it without verification is unlawful per 18 U.S.C. 8. 


2. False Claims Act and FCRA Violations The fraudulent reporting of debts and misrepresentation of obligations violate the False Claims Act ( 31 U.S.C. 3729 ), which penalizes false claims and misrepresentations. Any fraudulent claims tied to verification, validation, or reporting violate the False Claims Act ( 31 U.S.C. 3729 ).

Failure to maintain accurate credit reporting procedures constitutes violations under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ). 

XXXX. Unverified Charge-Off Accounts and Reporting Fraud Multiple charge-off accounts, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX remain unverified and fail to meet Metro 2 compliance standards.

The unauthorized reporting, transfer, or use of my SSN without lawful authority constitutes aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. 1028A.

2024-12-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to dispute the accuracy and validity of a charge-off account that has been reported on my consumer report. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., I have the right to accurate and complete information in my credit reports. I believe the information regarding this charge-off account is inaccurate and/or incomplete, and I request an immediate investigation into this matter.

Potential Inaccuracies and Issues : 1. Chargeoff with {$0.00} Balance : o The account is marked as Collection/Chargeoff, but the balance is {$0.00}. This is inconsistent with the high credit of {$2400.00} and requires clarification.

2. Account Transferred or Sold : o The comment indicates the account was transferred or sold, but no information is provided about the new creditor or details of the transfer. This makes the report incomplete.

3. Payment History Inconsistency : o The two-year payment history is marked as OK for all months, even though the account status is listed as derogatory and charged off. This is contradictory and inaccurate. 
4. Future Reporting Date : o The "" Last Reported '' date is XX/XX/XXXX, which violates the FCRA 's requirement for timely and accurate reporting. 
5. Missing Information : o XXXX and TransUnion : The details for these bureaus are incomplete or missing entirely, which makes the report inconsistent across bureaus. 



XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Potential Inaccuracies : 1. Chargeoff Status with {$0.00} Balance : o The account is listed as Charged off as bad debt with a {$0.00} balance. If the account was charged off, there should typically be a balance or further clarification on the transfer or resolution.

2. Missing Information on Transfer : o The comment Purchased by another lender lacks details. The new lender or purchaser should be listed, and this must be clarified in the account report.

3. Credit Limit Reporting : o A credit limit of {$0.00} is inconsistent with the reported high credit of {$5000.00}. This discrepancy may indicate inaccurate or incomplete data.

4. Future Reporting Dates : o The "" Last Reported '' date is XX/XX/XXXX, which is acceptable, but discrepancies in other accounts often show future dates that need careful review. 
XXXX. Incomplete Payment History : o The two-year payment history is blank, even though the account was open and reported as active until XX/XX/XXXX. This incomplete reporting violates FCRA Section 607 ( b ), which mandates accurate and complete information.

Applicable Legal Basis for Dispute 1. Verification Requirement ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) : - The FCRA mandates that all disputed information be verified within 30 days of a consumers dispute. If the information can not be verified, it must be corrected or deleted.

2. Obligation of Accuracy ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) : - Consumer reporting agencies must ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer reports. The inaccurate or unverifiable information regarding the charge-off account violates this requirement.

3. Re-Aging of Debt ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ) : - The FCRA prohibits re-aging of old debt. If the date of first delinquency is inaccurately reported, the charge-off may appear on my credit report longer than the allowed 7 years.

4. Validation of Debt ( Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) : - Under the FDCPA, if the debt is being collected by a third party, I have the right to request validation of the debt, including proof of ownership and the amount owed.

The account in question is being reported incorrectly by XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax, and I demand that it be immediately deleted from my credit reports. 

Account Information : Account Number ( redacted for security ) : XXXX Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Type : Credit Card Current Status : Closed ( by creditor due to inactivity ) High Balance : {$580.00} ( XXXX and XXXX ) ; {$500.00} ( Equifax XXXX Last Verified : XX/XX/year> Date Opened : XX/XX/year> to XX/XX/year> Date Closed : XX/XX/year> Balance Owed : {$560.00} Payment Status : Late 60 Days Discrepancies and Violations : Inaccurate Reporting of Credit Limit Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C . 1681c-2 ), a credit reporting agency is prohibited from reporting any credit limit for accounts that are closed, yet this account continues to report a {$500.00} credit limit despite being closed. This is a clear violation of the FCRA, as the credit limit reported is no longer relevant after the account has been closed.

Failure to Correct Reporting of Account Status The account is marked as "" Closed '' and the creditor 's remarks indicate that the account was "" canceled by credit grantor due to inactivity. '' However, the account is still being reported with incorrect late payment information. Under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), when an account is disputed, the creditor must correct the inaccuracies within 30 days of receiving the dispute. This account contains several incorrect and outdated details, including the reporting of late payments ( 60 days late ), which should not be on a closed account if it was paid off. 

Inaccurate Payment History The account is reported as being 60 days late across all three bureaus, even though the last payment was made on XX/XX/year> for XXXX and XXXX, and XX/XX/year> for Equifax. This inconsistency in reporting dates suggests an error or reporting delay and is misleading. 

Failure to Properly Verify Account Information The failure of XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax to ensure the accounts information is accurate violates FCRA Section 1681i, which mandates that they must correct or delete inaccurate information when the dispute is validated. The creditor has not properly verified the account details, as evidenced by the inconsistencies between the three reporting agencies.

Credit Reporting Post-Account Closure FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) requires that the information reported is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

2025-01-02,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,""" The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent. 

I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report. Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role and have a responsibility to report consumer information to the best of their ability with maximum possible accuracy like the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly states. I did not provide written consent to report them.

I am reaching out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) for legal assistance regarding a distressing situation I have encountered with Bank of Americas handling of my claim. 

On XX/XX/year>, I opened a dispute concerning a transaction with a merchant, XXXX XXXX, for a XXXX XXXX experience that went awry. The details of the claim are as follows : - **Claim ID : ** XXXX - **Claim Amount : ** {$5900.00} - **Claim Opened : ** XX/XX/year> Approximately a month ago, I presented Bank of America with sufficient and reasonable documentation supporting my request for a refund. The issues began when I initially booked my stay on the cruise ship, only to later discover that the room was no longer available and that I would have to accept a downgraded accommodation. The merchant informed me that while a refund for the initial booking was promised, securing a new room would necessitate an immediate additional payment. As such, I used my XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( ending in XXXX ) to pay for the downgraded room. 

Despite my attempts to secure a refund from XXXX XXXX, I have received no response to my numerous inquiries. However, after the dispute was initiated with Bank of America, I finally received acknowledgment from the merchant that they were reviewing my issue. I provided Bank of America with all relevant communications and evidence, yet my dispute was inexplicably closed in favor of XXXX XXXX  without a thorough investigation into the matter. 

I find Bank of Americas handling of my claim to be unprofessional and negligent. It is concerning that they closed my dispute without adequately considering the evidence presented. As a result, I am left without the funds owed to me. 

I am now seeking legal advice and assistance from the CFPB regarding this matter. I believe it is crucial for financial institutions to uphold their obligations to investigate customer disputes fairly and thoroughly.

The account in question is completely inaccurate and baseless, as I have no existing child support case or obligation. The reporting of this account not only damages my credit standing but also directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically under sections related to the duty to report accurate information and conduct reasonable investigations. 

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of information on consumer reports. By allowing this erroneous account to appear on my report, the credit bureaus have failed in this statutory obligation. Furthermore, their failure to remove this account after I previously disputed it indicates a lack of reasonable reinvestigation under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ).

Additionally, the willful and reckless nature of this reporting constitutes a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681n, exposing the credit bureaus to liability for damages, statutory fines, and attorneys fees. The reporting of this account also creates unwarranted financial harm, as it misrepresents my creditworthiness and undermines my ability to access credit, housing, and other necessities.

I am requesting the CFPB to investigate this matter thoroughly and hold the credit bureaus accountable for their blatant disregard of federal law. Specifically, I ask that : This XXXX XXXX account ( # XXXX ) be permanently deleted from my credit file across all reporting agencies.

I made a payment for {$870.00}, but it was withdrawn twice. When I called, I spoke to a gentleman who explained that the duplicate payment couldnt be refunded electronically and would need to be mailed as a check. I agreed to this and was told it would take a couple of days for the account to zero out since there was a credit of {$870.00} showing at the time of my call. For reference, I only received XXXX confirmation number for the payment I made. 

It wasnt until XX/XX/XXXX that the account was finally adjusted and zeroed out. Then, at the end of XXXX, I called again to check on the status of the refund. The agent told me the check had already been mailed. Shortly after, I received a letter in the mail, which I assumed contained the check. However, it was just a notice stating the check would be sent after the amount was verified. That same agent told me to wait until the end of XXXX and to call back if I didnt receive it so they could issue a stop payment. 

Today, I called again and spoke with an agent who was completely unprofessional. After verifying my name, he just sat in silence. I had to ask if he was still there before he finally responded. I explained the situation and once again had to prompt him to respond, which was frustrating. Listen to call on XX/XX/XXXX for context. Eventually, he told me to wait longer for the refund. 

I requested a supervisor, who said the check was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX ( Which means I was lied to when I called previously ). When I asked about issuing a stop payment, I was told they couldnt do so until 30 days had passed. This makes no sense, as they should be able to verify whether the check has been cashed and take action immediately.

Given that XXXX has deleted these accounts due to their inability to verify the debt, I request that you conduct a thorough investigation into the matter and remove these unverifiable accounts from my credit report within 30 days or less. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) mandates that you correct or delete any unverifiable information within a reasonable time frame. Failure to comply with this request could result in legal actions. 

I would also like to remind you of the following legal protections under the FCRA : Section 611 of the FCRA : If any information is disputed by the consumer, the credit reporting agency must investigate the claim and, if the information can not be verified, must remove it from the consumers report within 30 days. 
Section 616 and 617 of the FCRA : If you willfully or negligently fail to comply with the requirements of the FCRA, I am entitled to pursue legal action, which may include suing for damages, as well as seeking statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} for willful violations.

Section 605 of the FCRA : The removal of unverifiable debt is not only a right but a requirement. If information is found to be inaccurate or unverifiable, it must be deleted promptly. 

Therefore, I respectfully request that you remove the two charge-off accounts from my credit report within 30 days due to their unverifiable nature. Should these accounts not be removed in the required timeframe, I will not hesitate to take legal action and will explore all available options to protect my rights under federal law.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

2024-12-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate late payment entries on my credit report regarding my account with XXXX  XXXX ( Account # XXXX ). These late payments appear to be reported in error, as the account is marked as XXXX across all bureaus and there is no valid evidence to support these entries. This is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and my rights as a consumer. 

Details : Account Name : XXXX  XXXX # XXXX Late Payments : The account is marked as Current across all three credit bureaus, yet late payments are reported inconsistently : XXXX : Reports 30 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and 60 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 
XXXX : XXXX 30 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and 60 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 
Equifax : XXXX 30 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX ), 60 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and 120 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 
This is a major discrepancy because : The Payment Status is listed as Current. 
The Past Due amount is {$0.00} across all bureaus, meaning no payments were late or owed. 
2. High Credit Discrepancy : XXXX and XXXX : List the High Credit as {$510.00}. 
Equifax : Lists the High Credit as {$0.00}, which is incorrect and inconsistent with other bureaus. 
3. Future Reporting Dates : XXXX and XXXX : "" Last Reported '' date is XX/XX/XXXX. 
Equifax : "" Last Reported '' date is XX/XX/XXXX. 
Reporting dates in the future violate FCRA Section 607 ( b ), which requires timely and accurate reporting. 
XXXX. Date Last Active : XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX. 
Equifax : XX/XX/XXXX. 
These discrepancies suggest inaccuracies in the account activity information. 
XXXX. Payment History Contradictions : The Payment History shows late payments for specific months ( XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), even though the account status is listed as Current with no past due amounts. 




Violation of Consumer Protection Laws : Violations of 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( FCRA ) : 1. 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Credit reporting agencies are required to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer information. Reporting late payments on a current account violates this standard.

I believe this late payment is erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history. 

Nature of the Complaint : XXXX. Inaccurate Reporting : The late payment listed on my credit report is inaccurate. I have consistently made my payments on time, as I have been enrolled in autopay for all my accounts. 
2. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of this late payment violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

3. Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payment may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

4. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files.

Furthermore, under the FCRA, articles 616 and 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o ) outline the civil liability for willful and negligent noncompliance, respectively. These provisions provide for damages, including actual damages, attorneys fees, and possible punitive damages, for failure to comply with the Act 's requirements.

Requested Resolution : I request that Transunion conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payment from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments.

I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of this entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer.

Additionally there are several late payment indicators listed, which make no sense as to the best of my knowledge all payments have been submitted on time however seeing as I haven't been receiving my statements its nearly impossible for me to know the accuracy of the payments received. The following reporting periods need to be corrected as paid on time and the late payment indicators removed : XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX.

I believe this late payment is erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history. 

Nature of the Complaint : XXXX. Inaccurate Reporting : The late payment listed on my credit report is inaccurate. I have consistently made my payments on time, as I have been enrolled in autopay for all my accounts. 
2. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of this late payment violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

3. Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payment may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

4. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files.

Furthermore, under the FCRA, articles 616 and 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o ) outline the civil liability for willful and negligent noncompliance, respectively. These provisions provide for damages, including actual damages, attorneys fees, and possible punitive damages, for failure to comply with the Act 's requirements.

Requested Resolution : I request that Transunion conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payment from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments.

I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of this entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer.

Attached is evidence that Celtic Bank through its affiliate Continental Finance intentionally generates bogus charges on both of my Celtic Bank credit card accounts.

As described in 10 USC 987, I am seeking restitution to cover my Losses 1. Acct # ending in XXXX XXXX credit cards 2. Acct # ending in XXXX XXXX credit card To protect our active-duty service members and their families, Congress declared that any violation of the XXXX renders that loan void from inception. 10 U.S.C. 987 ( f ) ( 3 ).

Accordingly, all of Agreements to a covered members that contain an MAPR that exceeds 36 percent are void, must be rescinded with restitution paid for all amounts.

I discovered that two credit cards provided to me by Celtic Bank violates The Military Lending Act, 10 U.S.C. 987, and the company refuses to address the matter in accordance with 10 USC 987. The law and statute were not followed by Celtic Bank through their affiliate Continental Finance. I am protected from predatory lending by Celtic Bank because of my borrower status under the Military Lending Act. 
All Active-duty service members and their dependents are Covered Borrowers as defined by 32 C.F.R. 232.3 ( g ) ( 1 ).

I allege Celtic Bank violates the MLA in at least six ( 2 ) separate ways : ( 1 ) Surpassing the 36 % Military Annual Percentage Rate ( MAPR ) statutory rate cap.

( 2 ) Non-compliance with MLA disclosure requirements.

Celtic Bank refusal to adhere to current law and statute, regarding this matter requires Celtics Bank immediate attention. As an internal remedy I request the deletion of the legally voided account from my credit report, the voiding of the contract, and the immediate return of all payments made to Celtic Bank, pursuant to 10 USC 987.

By suppressing the MLA 36 % cap, Celtic Bank has violated the MLA by not incorrectly including fees in its APR and surprising payment that generate an MAPR exceeding 90 %.

Celtic Bank combined made restitution for {$1300.00}. See attached statements.

2025-01-21,Debt collection,I do not know,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"Dear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding Midland Funding for significant violations of federal consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), as well as actions related to identity theft. 

Background 1. Fraudulent Account : The account in question is not mine. I am the victim of identity theft, and any claims that I owe this debt are fraudulent. 
2. Failure to Notify or Provide Verification : Midland Funding claims they mailed correspondence to me on XX/XX/year>, but I never received any such communication. This lack of notice and verification violates my rights under the FDCPA. 
XXXX. Violation of Cease-and-Desist Request : I explicitly requested Midland Funding to cease all communication and media activity regarding this fraudulent account. While they claimed they would cease contact, they continue to report negatively on my credit report. This is in direct violation of the FDCPA. 
4. Illegal Purchase of Account : If this account were legitimate ( which it is not ), Midland Funding violated my rights by purchasing an account without my knowledge or consent, which is illegal under federal law. Whoever sold the account is also in violation for unauthorized use and sale of my personal information, constituting identity theft. 
5. Data Breach Contribution : The breaches at XXXX and XXXX have further exacerbated the identity theft issue, allowing my information to be misused in this manner. 

Applicable Laws and Violations 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Unverified Reporting : Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ), companies are prohibited from furnishing inaccurate or unverified information to credit reporting agencies. Midland Funding has reported a debt without verifying its validity or ensuring it is accurate.

Failure to Investigate Disputes : The FCRA requires a thorough investigation of disputes. Midland Funding failed to conduct a proper investigation or provide evidence of the accounts legitimacy. 
Damaging Credit Reporting : Their continued reporting of this fraudulent account has harmed my credit profile without proper documentation or verification, violating my rights under the FCRA. 

2. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) Failure to Provide Debt Validation : Midland Funding failed to provide proof of the debt upon request, violating FDCPA requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1692g. 
Violation of Cease-and-Desist Request : Despite agreeing to my request for a cease and desist, Midland Funding continues to report negatively to credit bureaus, violating 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( c ). 
Unfair and Deceptive Practices : By pursuing a debt resulting from identity theft, they are engaging in unfair and deceptive practices prohibited under 15 U.S.C. 1692d-f.

3. Identity Theft and Privacy Protections Illegal Use and Sale of Information :
Midland Funding and the original creditor, whoever they may be, violated my rights under privacy laws by buying and selling my information without consent. This constitutes identity theft under the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1028 ). 
Data Breach Contribution : The XXXX and XXXX breaches, which enabled my personal information to be accessed and misused, highlight systemic issues that require investigation and enforcement. 

I have disputed with XXXX and XXXX several times and no one has yet to remove this account as it doesnt belong to me. 

Also the reason I may not have received the letter on XX/XX/XXXX is because you may have the wrong address!!!! My whole credit file is incorrect!

A detailed review of my loan documents and XXXX  own records reveals severe discrepancies, unexplained charges, and violations of multiple consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 

XXXX XXXX inconsistent accounting, misleading credit reporting, and excessive post-repossession fees have created an unfair financial burden on me. I demand a full investigation, removal of unjustified charges, correction of my credit report, and a full breakdown of my alleged balance. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX Misrepresented My Loan Balance & Payments XXXXXXXX XXXX own documents claim I made {$46000.00} in payments. However, after reviewing line-by-line transactions, it is clear that {$8500.00} of these payments were reversedmeaning my actual payments total only {$30000.00}. 

Breakdown of Payments vs. Reversals : Total Payments Recorded by XXXX : {$46000.00} Total Reversed Payments ( Returned/Cancelled ) : {$8500.00} Actual Payments Made : {$30000.00} Original Loan Balance : {$39000.00} Charged-Off Balance Claimed by XXXX : {$24000.00} Major Issues : XXXX included reversed payments XXXX their records, inflating my total payments to make it appear I still owe more than I should. 
Even after I paid over {$30000.00}, XXXX still claims I owe nearly {$25000.00}, which does not align with basic loan math. 
Failure to properly credit payments violates the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), which requires clear disclosure of how payments are applied. 

XXXX. XXXX Charged Excessive and Unjustified Repo Fees After repossessing my vehicle, XXXX XXXX piled on thousands of dollars in unexplained fees, including : {$530.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) {$530.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) {$290.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) {$110.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) {$30.00}, {$28.00}, {$110.00}, {$260.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) {$8200.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) A massive charge with no breakdown or explanation {$1300.00} ( XX/XX/year> ) Key Issues : XXXX has not provided a detailed breakdown of these fees or whether they were disclosed in my original loan agreement. 
They failed to show how much my repossessed vehicle was sold for, and whether that amount was properly deducted from my balance. 
It is illegal to continue adding interest after repossession, yet XXXX balance appears to be inflated even after the car was seized. 

XXXX. XXXX is Reporting False Information to Credit Bureaus ( FCRA Violation ) XXXX XXXX is reporting inaccurate and misleading information about this loan, violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Key Errors in Credit Reporting : Inconsistent Names on the Loan : My name is incorrectly reported in multiple ways : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( extra repetition of XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( completely incorrect last name ) If XXXX can not prove I signed for this loan under the correct legal name, they must delete this account from my credit report.

2025-01-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Personal information incorrect,"I recently disputed an incorrect address listed on my credit report and provided clear evidence of my current address. Despite this, the credit bureau refused to remove the incorrect XXXX, Texas address, claiming it was linked to an account I hold with XXXX. To address this issue, I contacted all companies reporting on my credit file to confirm the accuracy of their information. Each company, including XXXX, verified that their records were up-to-date and did not include the incorrect address. 

I then requested the credit bureau to provide evidence linking the disputed address to any account. Upon reviewing the information provided by the credit bureau, I verified this with XXXX, which confirmed that they do not have any account or record associated with a XXXX address. This clearly shows that the credit bureau failed to conduct a proper investigation, as required under FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), which mandates a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information.

In addition to the address dispute, I challenged inaccuracies regarding account statuses, incorrect open/close dates, and accounts that were not opened by me. To safeguard my identity, I placed a security freeze on my credit report, notified the bureaus of potential identity theft, and filed a police report pursuant to FCRA 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ), which outlines procedures for handling identity theft disputes.

Despite taking these steps, the credit bureau continues to mishandle my case. When I called and specifically requested to speak with the fraud department, I was transferred to the general information services team multiple times, delaying any meaningful resolution.

I only purchased gas, I did not authorize a charge for {$180.00}, and the car could not physically hold anywhere close to {$180.00} of gas at the price per liter that the station was charging. Subsequently I read reviews of the gas station showed that the practice of fraudulently overcharging was common. 

Note that my credit card number recently changed. I am providing the current card number in this complaint. If the original card number is required please contact me. 

I provided all of the documentation and proof available to me ( several times ). On XX/XX/XXXX, they denied because I had not provided proof that the correct amount should have been {$65.00}. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and explained that it was not possible to know the exact correct amount because I was not given a receipt. Furthermore, I had not authorized a charge of {$180.00} and the entire amount should be considered fraudulent ( I had only provided the {$65.00} estimate to try to be fair ).

Their mishandling of my claims, lack of transparency, and continuous delays have caused me significant financial hardship and emotional distress.

Background of the Issue : 1. Disputed Transactions : I reported unauthorized transactions totaling [ $ amount ] on my account. These transactions occurred in locations I have never visited and during times when I was verifiably elsewhere.

Despite providing supporting documentation, including [ evidence provided, such as police reports, travel logs, or other relevant information ], Bank of America has refused to reimburse the funds.

2. Repeated Requests for "" New Information '' : Bank of America has repeatedly requested "" new information '' to process my claims. However, they have failed to specify what additional information is required, despite my efforts to comply.

This vague and unreasonable demand has delayed the resolution process and exacerbated my financial and emotional distress.

3. Violation of Federal Regulations : Under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), Bank of America is required to investigate and resolve disputes within 45 days. Additionally, they are obligated to provisionally credit the disputed amount while investigating. They have not adhered to these requirements.

Their continued delays and lack of clear communication violate the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ).

4. Negligence in Protecting My Account : Bank of America failed to implement adequate security measures to prevent unauthorized transactions on my account. This negligence directly contributed to the financial loss I have suffered.

Impact of Bank of Americas Actions : The banks mishandling of my claims has caused : Severe financial hardship, as I have been deprived of the funds necessary to meet basic needs.

Emotional and psychological distress due to the prolonged and unjustified delays.

Loss of trust in their ability to protect my account and act in good faith.

Request for Resolution : I respectfully request the CFPB to intervene and require Bank of America to : 1. Fully reimburse the disputed amount of [ $ amount ] immediately.

2. Provide a detailed explanation of their handling of my claims and their failure to comply with federal regulations.

3. Implement stronger safeguards to prevent future unauthorized transactions and improve transparency in their claims process.

Supporting Documentation : I have attached the following documents to support my complaint : Copies of all correspondence with Bank of America regarding this matter.

Evidence of unauthorized transactions ( e.g., police reports, account statements ).

These issues have significantly impacted my financial stability, mental health, and overall well-being. The following outlines the practices and misconduct I have endured : 1. Unauthorized Accounts and Services Bank of America has added services to my accounts and opened products without my explicit authorization. These actions resulted in fees and account changes I did not request or agree to.

2. Deceptive Practices The bank repeatedly provided misleading information regarding fees, terms, and conditions of my accounts. For instance, I was not informed of overdraft protection terms, and certain fees were applied without notice.

3. Overdraft Practices I have been charged excessive overdraft fees, including multiple charges for the same transaction. Additionally, I was automatically enrolled in overdraft protection without my consent, causing unnecessary fees to accumulate over time.

4. Improper Handling of Disputes Bank of America failed to investigate disputes involving unauthorized transactions and identity theft in a timely manner. My repeated efforts to resolve these disputes were met with delays, improper conclusions, and violations of legal timelines for dispute resolution. 

5. Discrimination As a single, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I believe I have been subjected to discriminatory practices. My concerns were dismissed, and I was denied the assistance and accommodations needed to manage my accounts effectively. 

6. Debt Collection Practices The bank attempted to collect debts that were invalid or already settled. These actions caused undue financial stress and exacerbated my existing hardships. 

7. Unlawful Fees Bank of America charged fees for services I did not authorize or request. These charges were inconsistent, unexplained, and financially damaging.

8. Failure to Safeguard Consumer Information Due to the banks negligence in securing my personal information, I became a victim of identity theft. Despite notifying the bank of these issues, my accounts remained unprotected, exposing me to further fraudulent activity.

9. Loan Servicing Errors Bank of America mishandled loan payments by applying them incorrectly and providing me with inaccurate payoff information. This mismanagement caused confusion and financial difficulties. 

10. Violation of Fair Credit Reporting The bank reported inaccurate information to credit bureaus, which negatively affected my credit score. Despite notifying the bank, these inaccuracies were not corrected. 

Consequences of These Violations These practices have caused significant harm, including : Financial instability, resulting in multiple evictions. 

Emotional distress and mental health deterioration. 

An unsafe and unpredictable environment for my child. 

Long-term financial damage due to identity theft and fraudulent activities. 


Request for Investigation and Relief I am requesting that the CFPB investigate these matters thoroughly and hold Bank of America accountable for its actions. I am also seeking restitution for the financial losses and emotional distress caused by their misconduct.

2024-11-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information is missing that should be on the report,""" The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. 
So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. 


This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent. 
I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report.

I'm ready to take legal action to protect my rights and find a solution under the FCRA if we can't work this out. The inaccurate items that appear on my credit report have been a big obstacle for me.

The account details are as follows : Creditor Name :XX/XX/XXXXAccount Number : XXXX XXXX Date of Delinquency/Charge-off/Closure : XX/XX/XXXX Nature of Dispute : The debt in question should have been removed due to the passage of the [ seven-year ] reporting limit under 15 USC Code 1681c. Furthermore, I never received a Form 1099-C for the alleged cancellation of debt, which raises questions regarding the validity and status of this account.

Since I did not receive a Form 1099-C, there is no record that this debt was officially canceled or forgiven. This lack of documentation further supports my belief that the information is either obsolete or inaccurate and should not be included in my credit file. 

I request that you : 1. Immediately remove the outdated or incorrect account from my credit report.

2. Conduct a thorough investigation to verify the accuracy of this information and determine why a Form 1099-C was not issued.

3. Provide me with written confirmation that the disputed information has been removed or corrected once your investigation is complete. 

Under the FCRA, you are required to investigate this matter and correct any inaccuracies or outdated information within 30 days. Please consider this letter a formal dispute.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent.

Sending out a generic form letter through the e-Oscar system that does not even contain my reasons for the dispute is by no ones measure reasonable.

2024-11-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information is missing that should be on the report,""" The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent. 
I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report. Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role and have a responsibility to report consumer information to the best of their ability with maximum possible accuracy like the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly states. I did not provide written consent to report them.
